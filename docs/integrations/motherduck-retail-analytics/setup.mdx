# Setup: MotherDuck Retail Analytics Pipeline

## Prerequisites

Before building the pipeline, ensure you have:

### 1. Expanso Edge

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.expanso.io | bash
```

### 2. MotherDuck Account

1. Sign up at [motherduck.com](https://motherduck.com) (free tier includes 10GB storage)
2. Get your access token from **Settings → Access Tokens**
3. Save it — you'll need it for Step 6

### 3. S3 Bucket

Create a bucket for your retail data. Any S3-compatible storage works:

```bash
# AWS S3
aws s3 mb s3://my-retail-data

# Or use MinIO, Cloudflare R2, etc.
```

### 4. AWS Credentials

Ensure your environment has S3 write access:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

## Pipeline Architecture

The complete pipeline has 6 stages:

```
POS Terminal → [Generate] → [Enrich] → [Validate] → [Batch] → [Parquet] → S3 → DuckLake
```

Each step in this tutorial adds one stage. By the end, you'll have a production-ready pipeline that transforms raw POS events into compressed, partitioned Parquet files on S3 — ready for instant MotherDuck queries.
