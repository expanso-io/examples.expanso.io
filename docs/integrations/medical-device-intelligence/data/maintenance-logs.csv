VENT-4012,2026-02-10T08:15:00Z,M. Chen,ICU Bay 3,"Routine check — O2 sensor reading intermittent. Recalibrated and tested. Values stable after 10 min observation."
PUMP-7891,2026-02-10T09:32:00Z,R. Patel,Oncology 2F,"Patient reported alarm sounding every 20 min. Found occlusion sensor oversensitive after firmware update 4.2.1. Adjusted threshold per manufacturer spec."
VENT-4015,2026-02-10T10:45:00Z,M. Chen,NICU,"Humidifier chamber cracked — replaced unit. Noticed condensation buildup in expiratory limb. Cleared and tested. Flow readings normal."
MON-2234,2026-02-10T11:20:00Z,J. Torres,ER Triage,"SpO2 probe giving erratic readings on finger sensor. Cleaned contacts, replaced probe cable. Still intermittent — suspect main board connector. Escalated to biomedical engineering."
PUMP-7894,2026-02-10T13:05:00Z,R. Patel,Surgery Pre-Op,"Routine PM completed. Battery replacement (was at 23% health). All self-tests passed. Calibration within spec."
VENT-4012,2026-02-10T14:30:00Z,S. Williams,ICU Bay 3,"Follow-up on morning O2 sensor issue. Sensor failed self-test. Replaced O2 cell module. Post-replacement: all readings nominal across FiO2 range 21-100%."
MON-2238,2026-02-10T15:15:00Z,J. Torres,Med-Surg 4W,"NIBP cuff not inflating. Checked tubing — found kink near connector. Replaced tubing assembly. Tested at 80/120/160 mmHg sim: all within 3mmHg tolerance."
