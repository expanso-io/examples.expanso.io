VENT-4012 in ICU Bay 3 has been acting up all week. The O2 sensor has been drifting low — I recalibrated it this morning but it failed self-test by afternoon. This is the third O2 cell we've gone through on this unit in 6 months. I think the sensor housing might have a seal issue letting moisture in. The unit is 4 years old (installed 2022-03). Recommend we get Draeger out to inspect the housing before we burn through another $800 cell.

VENT-4015 in NICU — the cracked humidifier chamber was probably from the night shift nurse overtightening. I've seen this twice before on the Hamilton C1s. We should add a note to the nursing in-service about hand-tight only. The condensation issue might be related — if the chamber wasn't sealing right, the humidity path changes. Worth monitoring over the next few days.

MON-2234 in ER Triage — this one worries me. The SpO2 readings were jumping around even after new probe and cable. Biomed confirmed the board connector is degraded. This is a Philips MX800 from 2021. The connector issue has been showing up across our fleet — I think we've had 3 units with the same problem this quarter. Might be worth flagging to Philips as a potential systemic issue.

The PUMP-7891 firmware situation is frustrating. The 4.2.1 update was supposed to fix the air-in-line detection but it made the occlusion sensor way too sensitive. I had to roll back to 4.1.8. The manufacturer needs to know this is happening in the field — we can't be the only site seeing this. I've started a report but need the clinical engineering manager to sign off before I submit.

PUMP-7894 in pre-op was straightforward PM. Battery was low but that's expected at 2 years. No issues.

DEFIB-1102 passed all tests. Good unit. Battery trending down from 94% last quarter to 89% now — normal degradation curve. Pad expiration tracked in our system.

MON-2238 NIBP fix was a simple tubing kink. Quick repair. These Mindray units have been solid overall.

General note: We're getting low on Philips SpO2 probe cables (REF M1191B). Only 3 left in stock. With the MX800 connector issues, we're going through them faster. Please order 10 more.
