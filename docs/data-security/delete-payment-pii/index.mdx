# Delete Payment Card PII

Achieve PCI-DSS compliance by removing credit card numbers at the edge.

## The Problem

Purchase events contain credit card details creating compliance liability:
- Full card numbers violate PCI-DSS Level 1
- Expiry dates and CVV are high-risk cardholder data
- Massive fines, audit failures, data breach risk

## The Solution

Learn 3 payment data techniques:

1. **Delete** - Remove card numbers, expiry dates, CVV with `.without()` for zero tolerance
2. **Preserve** - Keep last four digits and payment type for analytics and fraud detection
3. **Validate** - Schema validation and output inspection for PCI-DSS compliance verification
