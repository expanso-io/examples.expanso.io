# Interactive Payment PII Deletion Explorer

**See PCI-DSS compliance in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 4 stages of payment data sanitization. Watch how sensitive credit card information is systematically removed while preserving analytics capabilities.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) showing PII removal at each stage
3. **Observe** how sensitive fields are deleted (highlighted in red/green)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what data was removed
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the compliance benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Input
Raw purchase event containing full credit card details. This violates PCI-DSS Level 1 requirements and exposes your organization to data breach liability.

### Stage 2: Delete Card Number
Remove the full credit card number using `.without("full_number")`. This is the highest-risk PII field that attackers target first.

### Stage 3: Delete Expiry Date
Remove the expiry date as well. Combined with card number deletion, this eliminates all high-risk payment PII that requires PCI-DSS Level 1 certification.

### Stage 4: Verify Result
Final PCI-DSS compliant output. Only `last_four` and `type` remain for fraud detection and payment method analytics - safe, compliant, and useful.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 4 stages, you now understand:

✅ **Selective deletion** - How to remove sensitive fields while keeping analytics data

✅ **PCI-DSS compliance** - Which payment fields are high-risk and must be deleted

✅ **Business continuity** - How to maintain fraud detection with last_four digits

✅ **`.without()` function** - Bloblang's clean way to remove multiple fields
