# Interactive Encryption Patterns Explorer

**See field-level encryption in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 6 stages of progressive encryption patterns. Watch as sensitive fields are encrypted while preserving analytics-safe metadata.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) JSON at each stage
3. **Observe** how sensitive fields are encrypted (red strikethrough) while analytics data is preserved (green highlight)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what processors were added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the encryption technique and compliance benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Sensitive Data
Raw payment and customer data with multiple PCI-DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA violations requiring immediate encryption.

### Stage 2: Payment Card Encryption
PCI-DSS compliant credit card encryption with last-4 preservation for customer service and brand detection for analytics.

### Stage 3: Personal Identifiers (PII) Encryption  
GDPR-compliant encryption of email, phone, and SSN while preserving domain, area code, and last-4 for business operations.

### Stage 4: Address Data Encryption
Location privacy through street address encryption while preserving city, state, and zip prefix for demographic analytics.

### Stage 5: Temporal Data Encryption
Birth date encryption with age cohort preservation for analytics while maintaining HIPAA compliance for sensitive dates.

### Stage 6: Multi-Key Security Architecture
Risk-based encryption using different keys for different data sensitivity levels with comprehensive audit metadata.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 6 stages, you now understand:

✅ **PCI-DSS Compliance** - How to encrypt card data while preserving customer service capabilities
✅ **GDPR Data Protection** - Field-level PII encryption with selective analytics preservation  
✅ **HIPAA Privacy** - Temporal data encryption with cohort-based anonymization
✅ **Risk-Based Security** - Multi-tier key strategies for different data sensitivity levels
✅ **Compliance Auditing** - Metadata tracking and audit trail generation for regulatory requirements
✅ **Production Operations** - Key versioning, rotation, and monitoring strategies

## Deep Dive into Each Pattern

Want to understand each encryption strategy in depth?

- [**Step 1: Payment Encryption**](./step-1-encrypt-payment-data) - PCI-DSS compliant card data protection
- [**Step 2: PII Encryption**](./step-2-encrypt-pii-fields) - Personal identifier protection with analytics
- [**Step 3: Address Encryption**](./step-3-encrypt-addresses) - Location privacy with demographic preservation
- [**Step 4: Date Encryption**](./step-4-encrypt-dates) - Temporal data protection with cohort analytics
- [**Step 5: Multi-Key Strategy**](./step-5-multi-key-strategy) - Risk-based key architecture
- [**Step 6: Production Operations**](./step-6-key-rotation-audit) - Key rotation, monitoring, and audit compliance

## Common Questions

### How do I decrypt data for authorized services?
Each pattern includes decryption examples with role-based authorization checks. See the complete pipeline for production-ready selective decryption.

### Can I use different encryption algorithms?
This guide focuses on AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption. Other algorithms can be substituted, but ensure they meet your compliance requirements (AES-256 is required for PCI-DSS).

### How often should I rotate encryption keys?
Key rotation frequency depends on data sensitivity: Payment keys every 90 days, PII keys every 180 days, address keys annually. See Step 6 for automated rotation strategies.

### What happens during compliance audits?
The audit metadata pattern creates a complete trail of encryption operations, key versions, and field transformations required for PCI-DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA audits.
