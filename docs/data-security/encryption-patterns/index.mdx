# Field-Level Encryption Patterns

Master production-ready field-level encryption that protects sensitive data while preserving analytics value.

## The Problem

Data streams contain sensitive information requiring encryption:
- Credit card numbers, CVV codes (PCI-DSS violations)
- SSN, email, phone numbers (GDPR/CCPA violations)
- Billing addresses (location privacy)
- Naive encryption destroys analytics value

## The Solution

Learn 6 field encryption patterns:

1. **Payment Card Encryption** - AES-256-GCM with last-4 preservation for PCI-DSS compliance
2. **PII Data Encryption** - Multi-field encryption with domain/area code preservation
3. **Address Encryption** - Street-level encryption with city/state/zip prefix preservation
4. **Date Encryption** - Sensitive date encryption with year/age ranges preserved
5. **Multi-Key Strategy** - Separate keys by data type and rotation frequency for breach containment
6. **Key Rotation & Audit** - Versioned keys with comprehensive audit trails for zero-downtime rotation
