# How to Remove PII from Data Streams

Personally identifiable information (PII) in data streams creates legal liability and compliance risks under regulations like GDPR and CCPA. This guide shows you how to build a data pipeline that identifies, hashes, anonymizes, and removes PII from streaming data while preserving data utility for analytics.

You'll learn to handle the most common PII types: IP addresses, email addresses, user names, credit card numbers, and location data. The pipeline processes PII at the edge before transmitting to cloud systems, reducing compliance scope and transmission of sensitive data.

## Why Remove PII at the Edge?

Processing PII at the edge provides several advantages:

**Compliance Benefits:**
- Reduces data subject to GDPR/CCPA (less data classified as PII)
- Minimizes cross-border data transfer requirements
- Simplifies data retention and deletion requests
- Creates audit trails close to data sources

**Technical Benefits:**
- Lower bandwidth costs (anonymized data is often smaller)
- Reduced centralized processing requirements
- Data remains useful for analytics without exposing individuals
- Faster compliance with deletion requests (PII never stored centrally)

**Security Benefits:**
- Smaller attack surface (PII not stored in multiple locations)
- Reduced breach impact (anonymized data less valuable to attackers)
- Defense in depth (multiple anonymization points)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, you'll need:

- **Expanso installed and running** - Complete [Getting Started](https://docs.expanso.io/getting-started) first
- **An edge node connected** to your orchestrator
- **Sample data containing PII** to test with
- **Basic understanding of data compliance** requirements (GDPR, CCPA)

## Problem Statement

Consider a typical user activity event from a web application:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.123Z",
  "event_type": "page_view",
  "user_name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "email": "sarah.johnson@example.com",
  "ip_address": "203.0.113.45",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...",
  "location": {
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "country": "US",
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "postal_code": "94102"
  },
  "page": "/products/premium-widgets",
  "referrer": "https://google.com/search?q=widgets",
  "session_id": "sess_abc123xyz",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "credit_card",
    "last_four": "4242",
    "full_number": "4242-4242-4242-4242",
    "expiry": "12/25"
  },
  "device_id": "dev_789",
  "metadata": {
    "campaign": "summer_sale_2025",
    "ab_test_group": "variant_b"
  }
}
```

**PII Elements Present:**
- `user_name` - Direct identifier
- `email` - Direct identifier
- `ip_address` - Indirect identifier (GDPR considers this PII)
- `location.latitude/longitude` - Precise location (high-risk PII)
- `location.postal_code` - Can identify individuals in small areas
- `payment_method.full_number` - Highly sensitive PII (PCI-DSS)

**Data We Need to Preserve:**
- Event type and page (analytics)
- Timestamp (time-series analysis)
- Campaign and A/B test data (marketing analytics)
- General location (city/country for regional trends)
- Session correlation (user journey analysis)

The challenge is removing/anonymizing PII while keeping data useful for business analytics.

## Solution Overview

This guide implements a multi-layered PII removal strategy:

1. **Delete** credit card numbers and precise coordinates (high-risk, no analytics value)
2. **Hash** IP addresses and emails (preserve uniqueness for counting, prevent identification)
3. **Generalize** location data (keep city/country, remove precise coordinates and postal codes)
4. **Pseudonymize** user names (replace with consistent IDs)
5. **Validate** the output contains no PII (schema enforcement)
6. **Audit** all PII operations (compliance trail)

Let's build the pipeline step by step.

## Step 1: Create the PII Removal Pipeline

Create a file called `pii-removal-pipeline.yaml`:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="pii-removal-pipeline.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {pipelineYaml}
</CodeBlock>

<a
  href="/files/data-security/remove-pii.yaml"
  download
  className="button button--primary button--lg margin-top--md"
>
  📥 Download Pipeline
</a>

---


This pipeline implements comprehensive PII removal in 11 processing steps:

**Steps 1-2:** Input validation
**Steps 3:** Pre-processing audit trail
**Step 4:** Delete high-risk PII (credit cards, precise coordinates)
**Steps 5-7:** Hash identifiers (IP, email, names)
**Step 8:** Generalize location data
**Step 9:** Add anonymization metadata
**Step 10:** Validate no PII remains
**Step 11:** Post-processing audit trail

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Configure the salt values used for hashing. These should be kept secret and rotated periodically:

```bash title="Set environment variables for hashing salts"
# Generate secure random salts (do this once, store securely)
export IP_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export EMAIL_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export USER_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Analytics endpoint
export ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT="http://analytics-service:8080/events"

# Node metadata (set by Expanso automatically)
export NODE_ID="edge-node-001"
```

:::danger Protect Your Salts
The salt values are cryptographic secrets. If an attacker obtains them, they can reverse-engineer hashed values through rainbow table attacks. Store salts in a secret management system (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) and rotate them periodically.
:::

**Salt Rotation Strategy:**

When rotating salts, you'll generate new hash values for the same inputs. Plan for this:

```bash
# Option 1: Dual-hash during transition period
# Hash with both old and new salts for 30 days
# Allows matching users across the transition

# Option 2: Accept hash break
# New salt = new hashes, users appear as "new"
# Acceptable if you don't need cross-period user tracking
```

## Step 3: Deploy the Pipeline

Deploy the PII removal pipeline to your edge nodes:

```bash
expanso job deploy pii-removal-pipeline.yaml
```

You'll see:

```
✓ Job 'pii-removal-pipeline' created
✓ Evaluation triggered
✓ Scheduling to matching nodes...
✓ Deployed to 3 nodes (edge-node-001, edge-node-002, edge-node-003)
```

**Verify the deployment:**

```bash
expanso job status pii-removal-pipeline
```

Expected output:

```
Job: pii-removal-pipeline
Status: running
Type: pipeline
Executions:
  - Node: edge-node-001
    State: running
    Since: 10 seconds ago
    Health: healthy
  - Node: edge-node-002
    State: running
    Since: 8 seconds ago
    Health: healthy
  - Node: edge-node-003
    State: running
    Since: 6 seconds ago
    Health: healthy
```

## Step 4: Test with Sample Data

Send the original PII-containing event from our problem statement:

```bash title="Send test event with PII"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "evt_12345",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.123Z",
    "event_type": "page_view",
    "user_name": "Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "sarah.johnson@example.com",
    "ip_address": "203.0.113.45",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "country": "US",
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194,
      "postal_code": "94102"
    },
    "page": "/products/premium-widgets",
    "referrer": "https://google.com/search?q=widgets",
    "session_id": "sess_abc123xyz",
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "credit_card",
      "last_four": "4242",
      "full_number": "4242-4242-4242-4242",
      "expiry": "12/25"
    },
    "device_id": "dev_789",
    "metadata": {
      "campaign": "summer_sale_2025",
      "ab_test_group": "variant_b"
    }
  }'
```

You should receive `200 OK` response.

## Step 5: Verify PII Removal

The processed event sent to your analytics system will look like this:

```json title="Output: Anonymized event (PII removed)"
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.123Z",
  "event_type": "page_view",

  # PII REMOVED - Replaced with hashes
  "user_id": "user_8f3e7a9c2d1b",
  "email_hash": "a4c2f1e9b3d7c5e8",
  "email_domain": "example.com",
  "ip_address_hash": "7b9d4e2f1c8a6e3b",

  # PII REMOVED - Generalized
  "location": {
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "country": "US",
    "region": "US"
  },

  # PII REMOVED - Deleted entirely
  # "payment_method.full_number" - DELETED
  # "location.latitude" - DELETED
  # "location.longitude" - DELETED
  # "location.postal_code" - DELETED

  # Safe fields preserved
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...",
  "page": "/products/premium-widgets",
  "referrer": "https://google.com/search?q=widgets",
  "session_id": "sess_abc123xyz",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "credit_card",
    "last_four": "4242"
  },
  "device_id": "dev_789",
  "metadata": {
    "campaign": "summer_sale_2025",
    "ab_test_group": "variant_b"
  },

  # Anonymization metadata
  "pii_metadata": {
    "anonymized": true,
    "anonymization_timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.234Z",
    "anonymization_version": "1.0",
    "node_id": "edge-node-001",
    "pipeline": "pii-removal-pipeline",
    "fields_removed": [
      "user_name",
      "email",
      "ip_address",
      "payment_method.full_number",
      "location.latitude",
      "location.longitude"
    ],
    "fields_hashed": [
      "ip_address_hash",
      "email_hash",
      "user_id"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Compare Before and After:**

| Field | Before (PII) | After (Anonymized) | Technique |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| `user_name` | "Sarah Johnson" | "user_8f3e7a9c2d1b" | Pseudonymization (hash) |
| `email` | "sarah.johnson@example.com" | "a4c2f1e9b3d7c5e8" + domain | Hash + domain extraction |
| `ip_address` | "203.0.113.45" | "7b9d4e2f1c8a6e3b" | SHA-256 hash |
| `location.latitude` | 37.7749 | (deleted) | Deletion |
| `location.longitude` | -122.4194 | (deleted) | Deletion |
| `location.postal_code` | "94102" | (deleted) | Deletion |
| `payment_method.full_number` | "4242-4242-4242-4242" | (deleted) | Deletion |

**What's Preserved for Analytics:**

✅ Event type and page URLs (user behavior)
✅ Timestamps (time-series analysis)
✅ Campaign and A/B test groups (marketing analytics)
✅ City and country (regional trends)
✅ Session IDs (user journey tracking)
✅ Hashed user IDs (unique user counting)
✅ Email domains (organizational analysis)
✅ User agent (device/browser analysis)

**What's Removed (PII):**

❌ Personal names
❌ Email addresses (but domain preserved)
❌ IP addresses (but hash preserved for abuse detection)
❌ Precise locations
❌ Payment card numbers

## Step 6: Verify Hash Consistency

Hash functions are deterministic - the same input always produces the same hash. This preserves user uniqueness for counting:

```bash title="Send another event from the same user"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "evt_12346",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:25:10.000Z",
    "event_type": "add_to_cart",
    "user_name": "Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "sarah.johnson@example.com",
    "ip_address": "203.0.113.45",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "page": "/cart",
    "session_id": "sess_abc123xyz"
  }'
```

The output will have **the same hash values**:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_12346",
  "user_id": "user_8f3e7a9c2d1b",     // SAME as evt_12345
  "email_hash": "a4c2f1e9b3d7c5e8",  // SAME as evt_12345
  "ip_address_hash": "7b9d4e2f1c8a6e3b"  // SAME as evt_12345
}
```

This allows your analytics system to:
- Count unique users (by `user_id`)
- Track user journeys (same `user_id` across events)
- Detect fraud patterns (same `ip_address_hash`)
- Segment by email provider (by `email_domain`)

**Without** being able to identify who the actual person is.

## Step 7: Verify Audit Trail

Check the audit log to ensure PII operations are being tracked:

```bash title="View audit trail"
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl | jq .
```

You'll see audit entries like:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.234Z",
  "action": "pii_removed",
  "status": "success",
  "fields_processed": 9
}
```

This audit trail proves:
- When PII was processed
- Which event was anonymized
- How many fields were modified
- Success or failure status

**Compliance Value:**

GDPR Article 30 requires maintaining records of processing activities. This audit log satisfies that requirement by documenting:

1. **What data was processed** (event_id)
2. **When it was processed** (timestamp)
3. **What operations were performed** (fields_removed, fields_hashed)
4. **Who performed it** (node_id, pipeline version)

Store audit logs for the duration required by your data retention policy (typically 3-7 years).

## Step 8: Test Validation Failures

Let's verify the pipeline rejects events that fail PII validation. Create a processor that "forgets" to remove PII:

```bash title="Send an event designed to fail validation"
# This would only fail if we modify the pipeline to skip a removal step
# For testing, we can check the DLQ for any actual failures

# View dead letter queue
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl | jq .
```

In production, validation failures might occur due to:
- Schema changes (new PII fields added upstream)
- Processor bugs (removal logic fails)
- Unexpected data formats (PII in unexpected fields)

Failed events go to the dead letter queue for manual review:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_99999",
  "error": "PII validation failed: found user_name, email",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:30:00.000Z",
  "original_event": {...}
}
```

:::caution Review DLQ Regularly
The dead letter queue may contain actual PII from failed validations. Access should be restricted to compliance officers, and the DLQ should be purged after investigation.
:::

## Production Considerations

### 1. Hash Salt Management

**Problem:** Salts are cryptographic secrets that must be protected and rotated.

**Solution:** Use a secret management system:

```yaml title="Integration with HashiCorp Vault"
# In your pipeline config
config:
  pipeline:
    processors:
      - mapping: |
          root = this

          # Fetch salt from Vault at runtime
          let ip_salt = env("VAULT_IP_SALT").or(
            throw("Missing IP_SALT from Vault")
          )

          root.ip_address_hash = (this.ip_address + ip_salt).hash("sha256").slice(0, 16)
```

**Rotation Strategy:**

```bash
# 1. Generate new salt
NEW_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# 2. Update Vault
vault kv put secret/pii-pipeline/salts ip_salt=$NEW_SALT

# 3. Restart pipelines to pick up new salt
expanso job restart pii-removal-pipeline
```

During rotation, you can temporarily dual-hash:

```yaml
# Hash with both old and new salts during transition
- mapping: |
    root = this
    root.ip_address_hash_v1 = (this.ip_address + env("OLD_SALT")).hash("sha256").slice(0, 16)
    root.ip_address_hash_v2 = (this.ip_address + env("NEW_SALT")).hash("sha256").slice(0, 16)
```

After 30 days (or your chosen transition period), drop the old hash.

### 2. Schema Enforcement

**Problem:** New PII fields might be added upstream without updating the pipeline.

**Solution:** Use JSON Schema validation:

```yaml
# Add before the first processor
- json_schema:
    schema: |
      {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "event_id": {"type": "string"},
          "timestamp": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"},
          "event_type": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["event_id", "timestamp", "event_type"],
        # IMPORTANT: Explicitly disallow PII fields
        "not": {
          "anyOf": [
            {"required": ["ssn"]},
            {"required": ["credit_card"]},
            {"required": ["passport_number"]}
          ]
        }
      }
```

This fails fast if prohibited PII fields are present.

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Problem:** Hashing is CPU-intensive and can become a bottleneck.

**Current throughput:** ~1000 events/sec/core for SHA-256 hashing

**Optimization strategies:**

```yaml
# Strategy 1: Use faster hash functions for non-cryptographic use cases
- mapping: |
    # xxHash is 10x faster than SHA-256 for non-cryptographic hashing
    root.user_id = "user_" + this.user_name.hash("xxhash64").slice(0, 12)
```

:::caution Hash Function Selection
Use SHA-256 for PII that requires cryptographic security (GDPR compliance). Use faster hashes (xxHash) for internal IDs where reversibility is not a concern.
:::

```yaml
# Strategy 2: Batch hashing operations
- mapping: |
    # Hash all fields in one operation
    let salt = env("HASH_SALT")
    let hash_input = this.email + this.ip_address + this.user_name + salt
    let combined_hash = hash_input.hash("sha256")

    root.email_hash = combined_hash.slice(0, 16)
    root.ip_hash = combined_hash.slice(16, 32)
    root.user_hash = combined_hash.slice(32, 48)
```

### 4. Compliance Documentation

**Problem:** Auditors need proof that PII removal works correctly.

**Solution:** Generate compliance reports from audit logs:

```bash title="Generate monthly PII processing report"
#!/bin/bash

# Extract audit logs for the month
MONTH="2025-10"
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl | \
  grep "$MONTH" | \
  jq -s '{
    period: "'$MONTH'",
    total_events_processed: length,
    successful_anonymizations: map(select(.status == "success")) | length,
    failed_validations: map(select(.status == "error")) | length,
    pii_fields_processed: map(.fields_processed) | add,
    processing_nodes: map(.node_id) | unique
  }' > pii-report-$MONTH.json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "period": "2025-10",
  "total_events_processed": 12450000,
  "successful_anonymizations": 12449950,
  "failed_validations": 50,
  "pii_fields_processed": 89550000,
  "processing_nodes": ["edge-node-001", "edge-node-002", "edge-node-003"]
}
```

Provide this report to auditors to demonstrate GDPR Article 30 compliance.

### 5. Data Retention and Deletion

**Problem:** GDPR "Right to be Forgotten" requires deleting user data on request.

**Solution:** Since PII is removed at the edge, you only need to delete:

1. **Audit logs** (contain event IDs but no PII)
2. **Dead letter queue** (may contain failed events with PII)

```bash title="Handle deletion request"
#!/bin/bash

USER_EMAIL="sarah.johnson@example.com"
EMAIL_HASH=$(echo -n "${USER_EMAIL}${EMAIL_SALT}" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1 | cut -c1-16)

# 1. Remove from audit logs
grep -v "$EMAIL_HASH" /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl > /tmp/cleaned-audit.jsonl
mv /tmp/cleaned-audit.jsonl /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-cleaned.jsonl

# 2. Purge from DLQ (may contain actual PII)
grep -v "$USER_EMAIL" /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl > /tmp/cleaned-dlq.jsonl
mv /tmp/cleaned-dlq.jsonl /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-cleaned.jsonl

# 3. Analytics data already anonymized - no action needed!
echo "Deletion complete: $USER_EMAIL (hash: $EMAIL_HASH)"
```

**Key advantage:** Since analytics data contains only hashes, it's not subject to deletion requests under GDPR (anonymized data is outside GDPR scope).

## Edge Processing Context

This pipeline is designed specifically for edge deployment. Here's why edge processing is critical for PII removal:

### Bandwidth Savings

**Before (PII transmitted to cloud):**
```
Average event size: 2.5 KB (with PII)
Events per second: 1000
Daily bandwidth: 2.5 KB × 1000 × 86400 = 216 GB/day
Monthly cost (at $0.09/GB): $583/month
```

**After (PII removed at edge):**
```
Average event size: 1.8 KB (PII removed)
Events per second: 1000
Daily bandwidth: 1.8 KB × 1000 × 86400 = 155 GB/day
Monthly cost (at $0.09/GB): $420/month

Savings: $163/month (28% reduction)
```

### Compliance Scope Reduction

**Before:**
- PII exists in: edge devices, network transit, cloud storage, analytics DB
- GDPR scope: All components
- Encryption required: End-to-end
- Deletion requests affect: All storage systems

**After:**
- PII exists in: edge devices only (removed before transmission)
- GDPR scope: Edge devices only
- Encryption required: Edge to first hop
- Deletion requests affect: Edge devices only

### Latency Benefits

**Cloud PII removal:**
```
1. Edge → Cloud: 50ms
2. Cloud processing: 10ms
3. Cloud → Analytics: 20ms
Total: 80ms
```

**Edge PII removal:**
```
1. Edge processing: 5ms
2. Edge → Analytics: 45ms
Total: 50ms

Latency reduction: 37%
```

### Regional Compliance

Different regions have different PII regulations:

```yaml title="Region-specific PII rules"
# Deploy to EU nodes with stricter rules
selector:
  match_labels:
    region: eu-west

config:
  pipeline:
    processors:
      # EU: Remove IP addresses entirely (no hashing)
      - mapping: |
          root = this.without("ip_address")

      # EU: Remove all location data (GDPR Article 9)
      - mapping: |
          root = this.without("location")
```

```yaml title="US nodes can preserve more data"
selector:
  match_labels:
    region: us-west

config:
  pipeline:
    processors:
      # US: Hash IP addresses (allowed under CCPA)
      - mapping: |
          root.ip_hash = this.ip_address.hash("sha256")

      # US: Keep city/state (allowed under CCPA)
      - mapping: |
          root.location = {
            "city": this.location.city,
            "state": this.location.state
          }
```

This allows **region-specific compliance** without modifying your central analytics systems.

## Verification

Verify the pipeline is working correctly:

### 1. Test PII Removal

```bash title="Verify all PII types are removed"
# Send test event with all PII types
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "test_001",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z",
    "event_type": "test",
    "user_name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "ip_address": "192.0.2.1",
    "location": {
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194,
      "postal_code": "94102"
    },
    "payment_method": {
      "full_number": "4111-1111-1111-1111"
    }
  }'

# Check the output contains no PII
# Expected: 200 OK
# Output should have hashes, not original values
```

### 2. Verify Hash Consistency

```bash title="Verify same input produces same hash"
# Send same user twice
for i in 1 2; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "event_id": "test_'$i'",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z",
      "event_type": "test",
      "email": "same@example.com"
    }'
done

# Both events should have the same email_hash
```

### 3. Monitor Metrics

```bash title="Check PII removal metrics"
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep pipeline
```

Expected metrics:

```
pipeline_input_received{input="http_server"} 1000
pipeline_processor_error_total{processor="mapping"} 5  # Validation failures
pipeline_output_sent_total{output="analytics"} 995     # Successful anonymizations
pipeline_output_sent_total{output="audit_trail"} 995
pipeline_output_sent_total{output="dlq"} 5             # Failed validations
```

**Key metrics:**
- **pipeline_processor_error_total** - Events that failed validation (sent to DLQ)
- **`pipeline_output_sent_total{output="analytics"}`** - Successfully anonymized events
- **`pipeline_output_sent_total{output="dlq"}`** - Failed events requiring investigation

### 4. Audit Log Verification

```bash title="Verify audit trail is being created"
# Check audit log exists and has entries
ls -lh /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl

# Verify audit log structure
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl | head -1 | jq .
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.234Z",
  "action": "pii_removed",
  "status": "success",
  "fields_processed": 9
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Hashes are different for the same input

**Cause:** Salt value changed between requests

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check current salt value
echo $EMAIL_SALT

# Verify salt is consistent across edge nodes
expanso job env pii-removal-pipeline | grep SALT

# If salt changed, restore the original value or accept the hash break
```

### Problem: Events failing validation

**Cause:** New PII fields added upstream

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check DLQ for failed events
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl | jq .

# Identify the offending field
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl | jq '.error'

# Update pipeline to handle the new field
# Add to the deletion or hashing section
```

### Problem: High CPU usage

**Cause:** SHA-256 hashing is CPU-intensive

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check CPU usage
expanso job stats pii-removal-pipeline

# Option 1: Use faster hash for non-crypto use cases
# Replace SHA-256 with xxHash in the pipeline config

# Option 2: Scale horizontally
# Deploy to more edge nodes
expanso job scale pii-removal-pipeline --replicas 5

# Option 3: Batch events before processing
# Add batching in the input section
```

### Problem: Audit logs growing too large

**Cause:** High event volume creates large audit files

**Solution:**

```bash
# Rotate audit logs daily
cat > /etc/logrotate.d/pii-audit <<EOF
/var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl {
    daily
    rotate 90
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0640 expanso expanso
}
EOF

# Compress old logs
gzip /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl

# Archive to S3 for long-term compliance storage
aws s3 sync /var/log/expanso/ s3://compliance-logs/pii-audit/ \
  --exclude "*" --include "pii-audit-*.jsonl.gz"
```

### Problem: Need to identify a specific user from hash

**Cause:** Support request requires linking hash back to user

**Solution:**

:::danger Cannot Reverse Hashes
This is by design! Hashing is one-way. You cannot recover the original value from a hash. This is a feature, not a bug - it's what makes the data GDPR-compliant.
:::

**Workaround for legitimate use cases:**

```bash
# If you have the user's email (from support ticket)
USER_EMAIL="sarah.johnson@example.com"

# Compute their hash
EMAIL_HASH=$(echo -n "${USER_EMAIL}${EMAIL_SALT}" | \
  openssl dgst -sha256 | cut -d' ' -f2 | cut -c1-16)

# Search analytics for this hash
curl -X GET "http://analytics-api:8080/events?email_hash=$EMAIL_HASH"
```

You can go from email → hash, but never hash → email.
