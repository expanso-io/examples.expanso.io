# How to Remove PII from Data Streams

Build a pipeline that removes PII from streaming data at the edge—before it reaches your cloud systems. This reduces compliance scope, protects user privacy, and maintains data utility for analytics.

## Why Process at the Edge?

**Compliance:** Less data subject to GDPR/CCPA, simplified deletion requests
**Security:** Smaller attack surface, reduced breach impact
**Cost:** Lower bandwidth, less centralized processing

## The Problem

User events contain PII that creates compliance risk under GDPR/CCPA:

```json
{
  "event_type": "purchase",
  "user_name": "Sarah Johnson", // ❌ Direct PII
  "email": "sarah@example.com", // ❌ Direct PII
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100", // ❌ GDPR considers this PII
  "payment_method": {
    "full_number": "4532-1234-5678-9010" // ❌ High-risk PCI data
  },
  "location": {
    "latitude": 37.7749, // ❌ Precise location
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "city": "San Francisco" // ✅ Safe for analytics
  }
}
```

**The challenge:** Remove PII while preserving analytics value (event types, timestamps, regional trends).

## The Solution

This pipeline uses 4 techniques to handle different PII types:

1. **Delete** → Credit cards, precise coordinates (high-risk, no analytics value)
2. **Hash** → Emails, IPs (preserve uniqueness for counting)
3. **Pseudonymize** → User names (consistent IDs for tracking)
4. **Generalize** → Location (keep city/country, remove coordinates)

## Complete Pipeline Configuration

Ready to deploy? Here's the full pipeline configuration with all stages combined:

## Step 1: Create the PII Removal Pipeline

Create a file called `pii-removal-pipeline.yaml`:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="pii-removal-pipeline.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {pipelineYaml}
</CodeBlock>

<a
  href="/files/data-security/remove-pii.yaml"
  download
  className="button button--primary button--lg margin-top--md"
>
  📥 Download Pipeline
</a>

---

This pipeline implements comprehensive PII removal in 11 processing steps:

**Steps 1-2:** Input validation
**Steps 3:** Pre-processing audit trail
**Step 4:** Delete high-risk PII (credit cards, precise coordinates)
**Steps 5-7:** Hash identifiers (IP, email, names)
**Step 8:** Generalize location data
**Step 9:** Add anonymization metadata
**Step 10:** Validate no PII remains
**Step 11:** Post-processing audit trail

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Configure the salt values used for hashing. These should be kept secret and rotated periodically:

```bash title="Set environment variables for hashing salts"
# Generate secure random salts (do this once, store securely)
export IP_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export EMAIL_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export USER_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Analytics endpoint
export ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT="http://analytics-service:8080/events"

# Node metadata (set by Expanso automatically)
export NODE_ID="edge-node-001"
```

:::danger Protect Your Salts
The salt values are cryptographic secrets. If an attacker obtains them, they can reverse-engineer hashed values through rainbow table attacks. Store salts in a secret management system (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) and rotate them periodically.
:::

**Salt Rotation Strategy:**

When rotating salts, you'll generate new hash values for the same inputs. Plan for this:

```bash
# Option 1: Dual-hash during transition period
# Hash with both old and new salts for 30 days
# Allows matching users across the transition

# Option 2: Accept hash break
# New salt = new hashes, users appear as "new"
# Acceptable if you don't need cross-period user tracking
```

## Step 3: Deploy the Pipeline

Deploy the PII removal pipeline to your edge nodes:

```bash
expanso job deploy pii-removal-pipeline.yaml
```

You'll see:

```
✓ Job 'pii-removal-pipeline' created
✓ Evaluation triggered
✓ Scheduling to matching nodes...
✓ Deployed to 3 nodes (edge-node-001, edge-node-002, edge-node-003)
```

**Verify the deployment:**

```bash
expanso job status pii-removal-pipeline
```

Expected output:

```
Job: pii-removal-pipeline
Status: running
Type: pipeline
Executions:
  - Node: edge-node-001
    State: running
    Since: 10 seconds ago
    Health: healthy
  - Node: edge-node-002
    State: running
    Since: 8 seconds ago
    Health: healthy
  - Node: edge-node-003
    State: running
    Since: 6 seconds ago
    Health: healthy
```

## Step 4: Test with Sample Data

Send the original PII-containing event from our problem statement:

```bash title="Send test event with PII"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "evt_12345",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.123Z",
    "event_type": "page_view",
    "user_name": "Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "sarah.johnson@example.com",
    "ip_address": "203.0.113.45",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "country": "US",
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194,
      "postal_code": "94102"
    },
    "page": "/products/premium-widgets",
    "referrer": "https://google.com/search?q=widgets",
    "session_id": "sess_abc123xyz",
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "credit_card",
      "last_four": "4242",
      "full_number": "4242-4242-4242-4242",
      "expiry": "12/25"
    },
    "device_id": "dev_789",
    "metadata": {
      "campaign": "summer_sale_2025",
      "ab_test_group": "variant_b"
    }
  }'
```

You should receive `200 OK` response.

## Step 5: Verify PII Removal

The processed event sent to your analytics system will look like this:

```json title="Output: Anonymized event (PII removed)"
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.123Z",
  "event_type": "page_view",

  # PII REMOVED - Replaced with hashes
  "user_id": "user_8f3e7a9c2d1b",
  "email_hash": "a4c2f1e9b3d7c5e8",
  "email_domain": "example.com",
  "ip_address_hash": "7b9d4e2f1c8a6e3b",

  # PII REMOVED - Generalized
  "location": {
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "country": "US",
    "region": "US"
  },

  # PII REMOVED - Deleted entirely
  # "payment_method.full_number" - DELETED
  # "location.latitude" - DELETED
  # "location.longitude" - DELETED
  # "location.postal_code" - DELETED

  # Safe fields preserved
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...",
  "page": "/products/premium-widgets",
  "referrer": "https://google.com/search?q=widgets",
  "session_id": "sess_abc123xyz",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "credit_card",
    "last_four": "4242"
  },
  "device_id": "dev_789",
  "metadata": {
    "campaign": "summer_sale_2025",
    "ab_test_group": "variant_b"
  },

  # Anonymization metadata
  "pii_metadata": {
    "anonymized": true,
    "anonymization_timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.234Z",
    "anonymization_version": "1.0",
    "node_id": "edge-node-001",
    "pipeline": "pii-removal-pipeline",
    "fields_removed": [
      "user_name",
      "email",
      "ip_address",
      "payment_method.full_number",
      "location.latitude",
      "location.longitude"
    ],
    "fields_hashed": [
      "ip_address_hash",
      "email_hash",
      "user_id"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Compare Before and After:**

| Field                        | Before (PII)                | After (Anonymized)          | Technique                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `user_name`                  | "Sarah Johnson"             | "user_8f3e7a9c2d1b"         | Pseudonymization (hash)  |
| `email`                      | "sarah.johnson@example.com" | "a4c2f1e9b3d7c5e8" + domain | Hash + domain extraction |
| `ip_address`                 | "203.0.113.45"              | "7b9d4e2f1c8a6e3b"          | SHA-256 hash             |
| `location.latitude`          | 37.7749                     | (deleted)                   | Deletion                 |
| `location.longitude`         | -122.4194                   | (deleted)                   | Deletion                 |
| `location.postal_code`       | "94102"                     | (deleted)                   | Deletion                 |
| `payment_method.full_number` | "4242-4242-4242-4242"       | (deleted)                   | Deletion                 |

**What's Preserved for Analytics:**

✅ Event type and page URLs (user behavior)
✅ Timestamps (time-series analysis)
✅ Campaign and A/B test groups (marketing analytics)
✅ City and country (regional trends)
✅ Session IDs (user journey tracking)
✅ Hashed user IDs (unique user counting)
✅ Email domains (organizational analysis)
✅ User agent (device/browser analysis)

**What's Removed (PII):**

❌ Personal names
❌ Email addresses (but domain preserved)
❌ IP addresses (but hash preserved for abuse detection)
❌ Precise locations
❌ Payment card numbers

## Step 6: Verify Hash Consistency

Hash functions are deterministic - the same input always produces the same hash. This preserves user uniqueness for counting:

```bash title="Send another event from the same user"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "evt_12346",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:25:10.000Z",
    "event_type": "add_to_cart",
    "user_name": "Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "sarah.johnson@example.com",
    "ip_address": "203.0.113.45",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "page": "/cart",
    "session_id": "sess_abc123xyz"
  }'
```

The output will have **the same hash values**:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_12346",
  "user_id": "user_8f3e7a9c2d1b", // SAME as evt_12345
  "email_hash": "a4c2f1e9b3d7c5e8", // SAME as evt_12345
  "ip_address_hash": "7b9d4e2f1c8a6e3b" // SAME as evt_12345
}
```

This allows your analytics system to:

- Count unique users (by `user_id`)
- Track user journeys (same `user_id` across events)
- Detect fraud patterns (same `ip_address_hash`)
- Segment by email provider (by `email_domain`)

**Without** being able to identify who the actual person is.

## Step 7: Verify Audit Trail

Check the audit log to ensure PII operations are being tracked:

```bash title="View audit trail"
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl | jq .
```

You'll see audit entries like:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.234Z",
  "action": "pii_removed",
  "status": "success",
  "fields_processed": 9
}
```

This audit trail proves:

- When PII was processed
- Which event was anonymized
- How many fields were modified
- Success or failure status

**Compliance Value:**

GDPR Article 30 requires maintaining records of processing activities. This audit log satisfies that requirement by documenting:

1. **What data was processed** (event_id)
2. **When it was processed** (timestamp)
3. **What operations were performed** (fields_removed, fields_hashed)
4. **Who performed it** (node_id, pipeline version)

Store audit logs for the duration required by your data retention policy (typically 3-7 years).

## Step 8: Test Validation Failures

Let's verify the pipeline rejects events that fail PII validation. Create a processor that "forgets" to remove PII:

```bash title="Send an event designed to fail validation"
# This would only fail if we modify the pipeline to skip a removal step
# For testing, we can check the DLQ for any actual failures

# View dead letter queue
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl | jq .
```

In production, validation failures might occur due to:

- Schema changes (new PII fields added upstream)
- Processor bugs (removal logic fails)
- Unexpected data formats (PII in unexpected fields)

Failed events go to the dead letter queue for manual review:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_99999",
  "error": "PII validation failed: found user_name, email",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:30:00.000Z",
  "original_event": {...}
}
```

:::caution Review DLQ Regularly
The dead letter queue may contain actual PII from failed validations. Access should be restricted to compliance officers, and the DLQ should be purged after investigation.
:::

## Production Considerations

### 1. Hash Salt Management

**Problem:** Salts are cryptographic secrets that must be protected and rotated.

**Solution:** Use a secret management system:

```yaml title="Integration with HashiCorp Vault"
# In your pipeline config
config:
  pipeline:
    processors:
      - mapping: |
          root = this

          # Fetch salt from Vault at runtime
          let ip_salt = env("VAULT_IP_SALT").or(
            throw("Missing IP_SALT from Vault")
          )

          root.ip_address_hash = (this.ip_address + ip_salt).hash("sha256").slice(0, 16)
```

**Rotation Strategy:**

```bash
# 1. Generate new salt
NEW_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# 2. Update Vault
vault kv put secret/pii-pipeline/salts ip_salt=$NEW_SALT

# 3. Restart pipelines to pick up new salt
expanso job restart pii-removal-pipeline
```

During rotation, you can temporarily dual-hash:

```yaml
# Hash with both old and new salts during transition
- mapping: |
    root = this
    root.ip_address_hash_v1 = (this.ip_address + env("OLD_SALT")).hash("sha256").slice(0, 16)
    root.ip_address_hash_v2 = (this.ip_address + env("NEW_SALT")).hash("sha256").slice(0, 16)
```

After 30 days (or your chosen transition period), drop the old hash.

### 2. Schema Enforcement

**Problem:** New PII fields might be added upstream without updating the pipeline.

**Solution:** Use JSON Schema validation:

```yaml
# Add before the first processor
- json_schema:
    schema: |
      {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "event_id": {"type": "string"},
          "timestamp": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"},
          "event_type": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["event_id", "timestamp", "event_type"],
        # IMPORTANT: Explicitly disallow PII fields
        "not": {
          "anyOf": [
            {"required": ["ssn"]},
            {"required": ["credit_card"]},
            {"required": ["passport_number"]}
          ]
        }
      }
```

This fails fast if prohibited PII fields are present.

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Problem:** Hashing is CPU-intensive and can become a bottleneck.

**Current throughput:** ~1000 events/sec/core for SHA-256 hashing

**Optimization strategies:**

```yaml
# Strategy 1: Use faster hash functions for non-cryptographic use cases
- mapping: |
    # xxHash is 10x faster than SHA-256 for non-cryptographic hashing
    root.user_id = "user_" + this.user_name.hash("xxhash64").slice(0, 12)
```

:::caution Hash Function Selection
Use SHA-256 for PII that requires cryptographic security (GDPR compliance). Use faster hashes (xxHash) for internal IDs where reversibility is not a concern.
:::

```yaml
# Strategy 2: Batch hashing operations
- mapping: |
    # Hash all fields in one operation
    let salt = env("HASH_SALT")
    let hash_input = this.email + this.ip_address + this.user_name + salt
    let combined_hash = hash_input.hash("sha256")

    root.email_hash = combined_hash.slice(0, 16)
    root.ip_hash = combined_hash.slice(16, 32)
    root.user_hash = combined_hash.slice(32, 48)
```

### 4. Compliance Documentation

**Problem:** Auditors need proof that PII removal works correctly.

**Solution:** Generate compliance reports from audit logs:

```bash title="Generate monthly PII processing report"
#!/bin/bash

# Extract audit logs for the month
MONTH="2025-10"
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl | \
  grep "$MONTH" | \
  jq -s '{
    period: "'$MONTH'",
    total_events_processed: length,
    successful_anonymizations: map(select(.status == "success")) | length,
    failed_validations: map(select(.status == "error")) | length,
    pii_fields_processed: map(.fields_processed) | add,
    processing_nodes: map(.node_id) | unique
  }' > pii-report-$MONTH.json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "period": "2025-10",
  "total_events_processed": 12450000,
  "successful_anonymizations": 12449950,
  "failed_validations": 50,
  "pii_fields_processed": 89550000,
  "processing_nodes": ["edge-node-001", "edge-node-002", "edge-node-003"]
}
```

Provide this report to auditors to demonstrate GDPR Article 30 compliance.

### 5. Data Retention and Deletion

**Problem:** GDPR "Right to be Forgotten" requires deleting user data on request.

**Solution:** Since PII is removed at the edge, you only need to delete:

1. **Audit logs** (contain event IDs but no PII)
2. **Dead letter queue** (may contain failed events with PII)

```bash title="Handle deletion request"
#!/bin/bash

USER_EMAIL="sarah.johnson@example.com"
EMAIL_HASH=$(echo -n "${USER_EMAIL}${EMAIL_SALT}" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1 | cut -c1-16)

# 1. Remove from audit logs
grep -v "$EMAIL_HASH" /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl > /tmp/cleaned-audit.jsonl
mv /tmp/cleaned-audit.jsonl /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-cleaned.jsonl

# 2. Purge from DLQ (may contain actual PII)
grep -v "$USER_EMAIL" /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl > /tmp/cleaned-dlq.jsonl
mv /tmp/cleaned-dlq.jsonl /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-cleaned.jsonl

# 3. Analytics data already anonymized - no action needed!
echo "Deletion complete: $USER_EMAIL (hash: $EMAIL_HASH)"
```

**Key advantage:** Since analytics data contains only hashes, it's not subject to deletion requests under GDPR (anonymized data is outside GDPR scope).

## Edge Processing Context

This pipeline is designed specifically for edge deployment. Here's why edge processing is critical for PII removal:

### Bandwidth Savings

**Before (PII transmitted to cloud):**

```
Average event size: 2.5 KB (with PII)
Events per second: 1000
Daily bandwidth: 2.5 KB × 1000 × 86400 = 216 GB/day
Monthly cost (at $0.09/GB): $583/month
```

**After (PII removed at edge):**

```
Average event size: 1.8 KB (PII removed)
Events per second: 1000
Daily bandwidth: 1.8 KB × 1000 × 86400 = 155 GB/day
Monthly cost (at $0.09/GB): $420/month

Savings: $163/month (28% reduction)
```

### Compliance Scope Reduction

**Before:**

- PII exists in: edge devices, network transit, cloud storage, analytics DB
- GDPR scope: All components
- Encryption required: End-to-end
- Deletion requests affect: All storage systems

**After:**

- PII exists in: edge devices only (removed before transmission)
- GDPR scope: Edge devices only
- Encryption required: Edge to first hop
- Deletion requests affect: Edge devices only

### Latency Benefits

**Cloud PII removal:**

```
1. Edge → Cloud: 50ms
2. Cloud processing: 10ms
3. Cloud → Analytics: 20ms
Total: 80ms
```

**Edge PII removal:**

```
1. Edge processing: 5ms
2. Edge → Analytics: 45ms
Total: 50ms

Latency reduction: 37%
```

### Regional Compliance

Different regions have different PII regulations:

```yaml title="Region-specific PII rules"
# Deploy to EU nodes with stricter rules
selector:
  match_labels:
    region: eu-west

config:
  pipeline:
    processors:
      # EU: Remove IP addresses entirely (no hashing)
      - mapping: |
          root = this.without("ip_address")

      # EU: Remove all location data (GDPR Article 9)
      - mapping: |
          root = this.without("location")
```

```yaml title="US nodes can preserve more data"
selector:
  match_labels:
    region: us-west

config:
  pipeline:
    processors:
      # US: Hash IP addresses (allowed under CCPA)
      - mapping: |
          root.ip_hash = this.ip_address.hash("sha256")

      # US: Keep city/state (allowed under CCPA)
      - mapping: |
          root.location = {
            "city": this.location.city,
            "state": this.location.state
          }
```

This allows **region-specific compliance** without modifying your central analytics systems.

## Verification

Verify the pipeline is working correctly:

### 1. Test PII Removal

```bash title="Verify all PII types are removed"
# Send test event with all PII types
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "test_001",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z",
    "event_type": "test",
    "user_name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "ip_address": "192.0.2.1",
    "location": {
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194,
      "postal_code": "94102"
    },
    "payment_method": {
      "full_number": "4111-1111-1111-1111"
    }
  }'

# Check the output contains no PII
# Expected: 200 OK
# Output should have hashes, not original values
```

### 2. Verify Hash Consistency

```bash title="Verify same input produces same hash"
# Send same user twice
for i in 1 2; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events/ingest \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "event_id": "test_'$i'",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z",
      "event_type": "test",
      "email": "same@example.com"
    }'
done

# Both events should have the same email_hash
```

### 3. Monitor Metrics

```bash title="Check PII removal metrics"
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep pipeline
```

Expected metrics:

```
pipeline_input_received{input="http_server"} 1000
pipeline_processor_error_total{processor="mapping"} 5  # Validation failures
pipeline_output_sent_total{output="analytics"} 995     # Successful anonymizations
pipeline_output_sent_total{output="audit_trail"} 995
pipeline_output_sent_total{output="dlq"} 5             # Failed validations
```

**Key metrics:**

- **pipeline_processor_error_total** - Events that failed validation (sent to DLQ)
- **`pipeline_output_sent_total{output="analytics"}`** - Successfully anonymized events
- **`pipeline_output_sent_total{output="dlq"}`** - Failed events requiring investigation

### 4. Audit Log Verification

```bash title="Verify audit trail is being created"
# Check audit log exists and has entries
ls -lh /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl

# Verify audit log structure
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl | head -1 | jq .
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.234Z",
  "action": "pii_removed",
  "status": "success",
  "fields_processed": 9
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Hashes are different for the same input

**Cause:** Salt value changed between requests

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check current salt value
echo $EMAIL_SALT

# Verify salt is consistent across edge nodes
expanso job env pii-removal-pipeline | grep SALT

# If salt changed, restore the original value or accept the hash break
```

### Problem: Events failing validation

**Cause:** New PII fields added upstream

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check DLQ for failed events
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl | jq .

# Identify the offending field
cat /var/log/expanso/pii-dlq-*.jsonl | jq '.error'

# Update pipeline to handle the new field
# Add to the deletion or hashing section
```

### Problem: High CPU usage

**Cause:** SHA-256 hashing is CPU-intensive

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check CPU usage
expanso job stats pii-removal-pipeline

# Option 1: Use faster hash for non-crypto use cases
# Replace SHA-256 with xxHash in the pipeline config

# Option 2: Scale horizontally
# Deploy to more edge nodes
expanso job scale pii-removal-pipeline --replicas 5

# Option 3: Batch events before processing
# Add batching in the input section
```

### Problem: Audit logs growing too large

**Cause:** High event volume creates large audit files

**Solution:**

```bash
# Rotate audit logs daily
cat > /etc/logrotate.d/pii-audit <<EOF
/var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl {
    daily
    rotate 90
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0640 expanso expanso
}
EOF

# Compress old logs
gzip /var/log/expanso/pii-audit-*.jsonl

# Archive to S3 for long-term compliance storage
aws s3 sync /var/log/expanso/ s3://compliance-logs/pii-audit/ \
  --exclude "*" --include "pii-audit-*.jsonl.gz"
```

### Problem: Need to identify a specific user from hash

**Cause:** Support request requires linking hash back to user

**Solution:**

:::danger Cannot Reverse Hashes
This is by design! Hashing is one-way. You cannot recover the original value from a hash. This is a feature, not a bug - it's what makes the data GDPR-compliant.
:::

**Workaround for legitimate use cases:**

```bash
# If you have the user's email (from support ticket)
USER_EMAIL="sarah.johnson@example.com"

# Compute their hash
EMAIL_HASH=$(echo -n "${USER_EMAIL}${EMAIL_SALT}" | \
  openssl dgst -sha256 | cut -d' ' -f2 | cut -c1-16)

# Search analytics for this hash
curl -X GET "http://analytics-api:8080/events?email_hash=$EMAIL_HASH"
```

You can go from email → hash, but never hash → email.
