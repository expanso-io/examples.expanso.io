# Field-Level Encryption for Sensitive Data

**Encrypt sensitive data at the edge before it leaves your network boundary**. This step-by-step guide teaches you 6 essential techniques for protecting PII and PCI data through an interactive explorer and hands-on exercises.

## The Problem

Modern applications handle massive volumes of sensitive data: credit card numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, and protected health information. While TLS encrypts data in transit, it leaves data vulnerable once it reaches storage or processing systems where operators, DBAs, and compromised cloud services can access it in plaintext.

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "card_number": "4532-1234-5678-9010",  // ❌ Exposed to cloud operators
    "cvv": "123"                          // ❌ Visible in logs and backups
  },
  "customer": {
    "ssn": "123-45-6789",                 // ❌ PII compliance violation
    "email": "sarah.johnson@example.com"   // ❌ Marketing data exposure
  }
}
```

**The challenge:** Encrypt sensitive fields while preserving data utility for analytics, fraud detection, and business intelligence.

## The Solution: 6 Field Encryption Techniques

This guide teaches you how to apply the right encryption technique for each data type:

### 1. **Credit Card Encryption** → PCI-DSS Compliance
Encrypt card numbers and CVV codes while preserving last 4 digits and card brand
- **Use case:** Payment processing, PCI-DSS compliance
- **Method:** AES-256-GCM with partial preservation
- **Result:** Secure cardholder data with analytics utility

### 2. **PII Data Encryption** → Privacy Protection
Encrypt SSN, email, and phone numbers with selective preservation
- **Use case:** Customer data protection, GDPR compliance
- **Method:** Multi-field encryption with domain/area code preservation
- **Result:** Protected personal data with business intelligence capability

### 3. **Address Data Encryption** → Location Privacy
Encrypt street addresses and zip codes while preserving geographic trends
- **Use case:** Shipping data protection, location analytics
- **Method:** Granular field encryption
- **Result:** Private addresses with regional reporting

### 4. **Key Management** → Security Operations
Implement secure key storage, rotation, and versioning
- **Use case:** Production encryption operations
- **Method:** Multi-key strategy with rotation schedules
- **Result:** Enterprise-grade key lifecycle management

### 5. **Selective Decryption** → Access Control
Enable authorized services to decrypt specific data types
- **Use case:** Fraud detection, customer service
- **Method:** Key segregation and service authorization
- **Result:** Granular data access with audit trails

### 6. **Compliance Monitoring** → Regulatory Requirements
Track encryption coverage and audit compliance
- **Use case:** PCI-DSS audits, HIPAA compliance
- **Method:** Encryption metadata and audit logging
- **Result:** Automated compliance verification

## Why Process at the Edge?

**Defense in Depth:** Data encrypted before leaving your network, protected even if TLS is compromised
**Zero Trust Architecture:** Data protected at rest in cloud systems, reducing insider threat exposure
**Compliance Scope Reduction:** Encrypted data often exempt from strict regulatory requirements
**Granular Access Control:** Different keys for different data types, enabling selective access
