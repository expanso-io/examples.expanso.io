# Field-Level Encryption for Sensitive Data

Encrypt sensitive data at the edge before it leaves your network boundary.

## The Problem

TLS protects data in transit but leaves it vulnerable at rest:
- Credit card numbers exposed to cloud operators
- SSNs visible in logs and backups
- Email addresses accessible to compromised services
- PII compliance violations

## The Solution

Learn 6 field encryption techniques:

1. **Credit Card Encryption** - AES-256-GCM with partial preservation for PCI-DSS compliance
2. **PII Data Encryption** - Multi-field encryption for SSN, email, phone with selective preservation
3. **Address Data Encryption** - Street-level encryption while preserving geographic trends
4. **Key Management** - Secure key storage, rotation, and versioning for production operations
5. **Selective Decryption** - Key segregation and service authorization for granular access
6. **Compliance Monitoring** - Encryption metadata and audit logging for regulatory requirements
