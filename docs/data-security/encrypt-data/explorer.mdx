# Interactive Field Encryption Explorer

**See field-level encryption in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 6 stages of data transformation. Watch as sensitive fields like credit card numbers, SSNs, and PII are progressively encrypted while preserving analytics utility.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) JSON at each stage
3. **Observe** how sensitive fields are encrypted (red strikethrough) or preserved (green highlight)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what mapping processor was added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the encryption technique and compliance benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Payment Data
Raw transaction data with all sensitive fields exposed in plaintext. This represents the security risk: credit card numbers, CVV codes, SSNs, and PII are visible to anyone with database access.

### Stage 2: Encrypt Credit Card Data
The most critical step for PCI-DSS compliance. Credit card numbers and CVV codes are encrypted with AES-256-GCM while preserving the last 4 digits and card brand for customer service and fraud detection.

### Stage 3: Encrypt PII Customer Data
Personal identifiable information (SSN, email, phone) is encrypted while preserving useful analytics metadata: last 4 digits of SSN, email domain, phone area code, and birth year for demographic analysis.

### Stage 4: Encrypt Address Data
Geographic privacy protection by encrypting street addresses and detailed zip codes while preserving city, state, and country for regional analytics and compliance reporting.

### Stage 5: Add Encryption Metadata
Comprehensive audit trail including what was encrypted, when, with which key version, and by which system. Essential for compliance audits and key rotation tracking.

### Stage 6: Complete Encrypted Transaction
The final encrypted transaction ready for secure transmission and storage. All sensitive data is protected while maintaining full business intelligence capabilities.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 6 stages, you now understand:

✅ **Selective Encryption** - How to encrypt sensitive fields while preserving analytics utility
✅ **Multi-Key Strategy** - Using different keys for different data types
✅ **Compliance Requirements** - PCI-DSS and HIPAA encryption patterns
✅ **Metadata Preservation** - Keeping useful data attributes for business intelligence
✅ **Audit Trails** - Tracking encryption operations for compliance and key rotation
