# Content-Based Routing

Send the right data to the right place using conditional logic.

## The Problem

Without intelligent routing, you either:
- Send everything everywhere (wasting bandwidth, violating compliance)
- Create separate pipelines for each data type (duplicating configuration)

## The Solution

Learn 4 routing techniques:

1. **Severity Routing** - Critical alerts to PagerDuty, warnings to Slack, info to logs
2. **Geographic Routing** - EU data stays in EU (GDPR compliance)
3. **Event Type Routing** - Payments to fraud detection, auth to security systems
4. **Priority Queues** - Premium users get expedited processing

## Get Started
