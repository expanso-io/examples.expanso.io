# Interactive Content Routing Explorer

**See content routing in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 4 stages of content routing. Watch as messages are progressively routed to different destinations based on severity, region, event type, and priority.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) message routing at each stage
3. **Observe** how routing conditions determine destination selection (highlighted in green)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what switch configuration was added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the routing technique and business benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Input
All messages flow to a single destination regardless of content, severity, region, or type.

### Stage 2: Severity-Based Routing
Critical and warning messages are routed to appropriate alerting systems (PagerDuty, Slack) while informational messages go to searchable storage (Elasticsearch).

### Stage 3: Geographic Routing
Regional routing enforces data residency requirements - EU data stays in EU systems for GDPR compliance, while US data routes to regional clusters for performance.

### Stage 4: Event Type Routing
Different event types (authentication, payments, telemetry, analytics) are routed to specialized processing systems optimized for each data type.

### Stage 5: Priority Queue Routing
Messages are routed to different priority queues based on user tier and urgency, ensuring premium users and critical events get expedited processing.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 4 stages, you now understand:

✅ **First-match routing** - How switch conditions are evaluated in order
✅ **Default fallback** - Why every switch needs a catch-all case
✅ **Compliance enforcement** - How geographic routing satisfies GDPR requirements
✅ **Performance optimization** - How specialized routing improves processing efficiency

## Common Questions

### Why do conditions need to be ordered from specific to general?
Switch outputs evaluate conditions in order and use the first match. If general conditions come first, specific conditions will never be reached. For example, checking `region == "eu-west"` before `region == "eu-west" && severity == "CRITICAL"` ensures the specific case is handled.

### What happens if no conditions match?
Without a default case (no condition), unmatched messages cause errors. Always include a final case with no `check` property to handle unexpected data gracefully.

### How do I test routing logic?
Send test messages with different field values and verify they reach the expected destinations. Use pipeline metrics to monitor routing distribution and identify unhandled cases.
