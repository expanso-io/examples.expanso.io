# Smart Buffering for Priority-Based Delivery

Deliver critical messages first, regardless of queue depth.

## The Problem

Standard FIFO buffering treats all messages equally:
- Important alerts wait behind thousands of debug logs
- Payment failures queued after bulk analytics
- After reconnection, all backlogged messages compete equally
- New critical events can't preempt already-queued batches

## The Solution

Learn 4 smart buffering techniques:

1. **Priority Classification** - Categorize messages as important, regular, or archive
2. **Priority Scoring** - Assign numeric scores for fine-grained ordering
3. **Priority Output Routing** - Route tiers to separate outputs with different batching (important: no batching, archive: heavy batching)
4. **Starvation Prevention** - Age-based boost ensures all messages eventually send
