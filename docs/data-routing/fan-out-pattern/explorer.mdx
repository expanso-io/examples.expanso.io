# Interactive Fan-Out Pattern Explorer

**See multi-destination routing in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 5 stages of fan-out pattern implementation. Watch as data progressively gains routing capabilities to Kafka, S3, and Elasticsearch.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) YAML configuration at each stage
3. **Observe** how destinations are added (green highlight) and configurations evolve
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what broker pattern was configured
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the technique and edge computing benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Single Output
Basic pipeline with single destination - typical starting point before fan-out.

### Stage 2: Broker Fan-Out Foundation
Introduction of broker output with fan_out pattern for concurrent delivery.

### Stage 3: Kafka Integration
Real-time streaming destination added with optimized batching for low latency.

### Stage 4: S3 Archive Addition
Long-term storage destination with large batches and compression for cost efficiency.

### Stage 5: Elasticsearch Search
Search and analytics destination with moderate batching for freshness balance.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 5 stages, you now understand:

✅ **Fan-out fundamentals** - How broker pattern enables concurrent multi-destination delivery
✅ **Progressive configuration** - Building from single to multiple destinations incrementally
✅ **Destination optimization** - Tailoring batching and compression per destination type
✅ **Edge computing benefits** - Local processing with multiple cloud integrations

## Common Questions

### How does fan-out differ from sequential routing?
Fan-out sends to all destinations concurrently, while sequential routing processes one destination at a time. This means faster overall delivery and failure isolation.

### What happens if one destination is slower than others?
Each destination operates independently. A slow S3 upload won't block real-time Kafka streaming or Elasticsearch indexing.

### Can I add destinations dynamically?
Yes, you can modify the broker outputs configuration and deploy updates. New destinations will start receiving data, while existing ones continue uninterrupted.

### How do I handle destination-specific data transformations?
Use processor chains before the broker output, or configure per-output processors within each destination's configuration section.
