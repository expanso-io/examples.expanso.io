# Fan-Out Pattern for Multiple Destinations

Send data to multiple destinations simultaneously without duplication overhead.

## The Problem

Edge processing needs to send the same data to multiple destinations:
- Kafka for real-time streaming, S3 for archive, Elasticsearch for search
- Each destination has different requirements and failure modes
- One destination failure shouldn't block others

## The Solution

Learn 5 fan-out routing techniques:

1. **Concurrent Distribution** - Parallel delivery with broker output and fan_out pattern
2. **Independent Retry Logic** - Per-destination retry and backoff configuration
3. **Batching Optimization** - Destination-specific batching and compression tuning
4. **Failure Isolation** - Independent error handling and circuit breakers per destination
5. **Local Fallback Chains** - Local buffering with automatic cloud sync during outages
