# How to Implement Content-Based Splitting

When working with data pipelines, you'll often receive messages containing multiple logical events bundled together. A single HTTP request might carry an array of 100 sensor readings, a batch file might contain thousands of transactions, or a log stream might deliver multiline stack traces. Processing these as single messages creates problems: you can't route individual items differently, you can't apply per-item transformations, and you can't track individual event metrics.

Content-based splitting solves this by taking messages containing multiple items and expanding them into separate messages‚Äîone per item. This enables granular routing, per-event processing, and accurate observability.

## Problem Statement

Consider these common scenarios where splitting is essential:

**IoT Sensor Arrays**: Your edge device collects 1,000 temperature readings per minute and sends them as a JSON array. You need to:
- Send readings above 80¬∞C to an immediate alert system
- Store readings between 70-80¬∞C in a warm storage tier
- Batch readings below 70¬∞C for historical analysis
- Track per-sensor metrics and failure rates

**Batch Transaction Files**: Your payment processor delivers CSV files containing thousands of transactions. You need to:
- Route international transactions to compliance checking
- Send high-value transactions (>$10,000) to fraud detection
- Batch low-value domestic transactions to standard processing
- Generate per-transaction audit trails

**Multiline Log Aggregation**: Application logs arrive as multiline entries (stack traces, JSON objects). You need to:
- Parse each complete log entry independently
- Route ERROR logs to alerting while INFO goes to archive
- Extract structured data from each log entry

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

- An Expanso edge node running and connected to the orchestrator
- Access credentials for your destination services

For background on Bloblang expressions used in splitting logic, see the [Bloblang Guide](https://docs.expanso.io/guides/bloblang).

## Solution Overview

Expanso provides multiple approaches to splitting messages based on your data format:

```
                   ‚îå‚îÄ‚Üí Message 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
Single Message     ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Message 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
(Array or Batch) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚Üí Message 3 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚Üí Content Routing ‚Üí Destinations
                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Message 4 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Message N ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

Key splitting mechanisms:

- **unarchive processor**: Splits messages based on format (JSON array, CSV lines, multiline delimited)
- **split processor**: Evaluates a Bloblang expression to extract items from complex structures
- **workflow branches**: Process split items through different pipeline branches
- **Edge-first splitting**: Split at the edge before cloud upload to enable per-item routing

The general pattern:
1. Receive bundled message (array, batch file, archive)
2. Split into individual messages using appropriate processor
3. Apply per-item transformations and enrichment
4. Route each item based on its content
5. Batch again if needed for efficient destination delivery

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Split JSON Arrays

The most common splitting scenario involves JSON arrays. Let's start with sensor data delivered as an array:

```json title="Input: Sensor array"
{
  "device_id": "sensor-001",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z",
  "readings": [
    {"sensor": "temp-1", "value": 72.5, "unit": "F"},
    {"sensor": "temp-2", "value": 85.3, "unit": "F"},
    {"sensor": "temp-3", "value": 68.1, "unit": "F"}
  ]
}
```

We need to split this into three separate messages, one per reading, while preserving device context:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="array-splitting-pipeline.yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {pipelineYaml}
</CodeBlock>

<a
  href="/files/data-routing/content-splitting.yaml"
  download
  className="button button--primary button--lg margin-top--md"
>
  üì• Download Pipeline
</a>

---


**Critical Pattern**: The parent message context (device_id, timestamp) must be preserved. Store it in metadata *before* the unarchive processor runs:

```yaml
# CORRECT ORDER:
pipeline:
  processors:
    # 1. Store parent context in metadata FIRST
    - mapping: |
        meta device_id = this.device_id
        meta batch_timestamp = this.timestamp
        root = this

    # 2. THEN split the array
    - unarchive:
        format: json_array
        field: readings

    # 3. THEN restore context to each split message
    - mapping: |
        root = this
        root.device_id = meta("device_id")
        root.batch_timestamp = meta("batch_timestamp")
```

Test this pipeline:

```bash title="Send test data"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sensors/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_id": "sensor-001",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z",
    "readings": [
      {"sensor": "temp-1", "value": 72.5, "unit": "F"},
      {"sensor": "temp-2", "value": 85.3, "unit": "F"},
      {"sensor": "temp-3", "value": 68.1, "unit": "F"}
    ]
  }'
```

Expected result: Three separate messages routed to different destinations based on temperature value.

### Step 2: Split CSV Batches

CSV files are another common batch format. Let's split a CSV file of transactions:

```csv title="Input: CSV transactions"
transaction_id,timestamp,amount,currency,country
txn-001,2025-10-20T10:00:00Z,150.00,USD,US
txn-002,2025-10-20T10:01:00Z,12500.00,EUR,DE
txn-003,2025-10-20T10:02:00Z,75.50,GBP,UK
```

Split this into individual transaction messages:

```yaml title="csv-splitting-pipeline.yaml"
name: split-csv-transactions
description: Split CSV transaction batches into individual messages
type: pipeline
namespace: production

config:
  input:
    file:
      paths:
        - /var/expanso/incoming/transactions-*.csv
      scanner:
        lines: {}
      codec: lines

  pipeline:
    processors:
      # Step 1: Skip CSV header row
      - mapping: |
          if this.string().has_prefix("transaction_id") {
            root = deleted()
          } else {
            root = this
          }

      # Step 2: Parse CSV line into structured JSON
      - mapping: |
          let fields = this.string().split(",")

          root.transaction_id = $fields.index(0)
          root.timestamp = $fields.index(1)
          root.amount = $fields.index(2).number()
          root.currency = $fields.index(3)
          root.country = $fields.index(4)
          root.processed_at = now()

          # Classify transaction size
          root.transaction_size = match {
            this.amount >= 10000 => "large"
            this.amount >= 1000 => "medium"
            _ => "small"
          }

          root.is_international = this.country != "US"

  output:
    switch:
      cases:
        # Large transactions to fraud detection
        - check: this.transaction_size == "large"
          output:
            broker:
              pattern: fan_out
              outputs:
                - http_client:
                    url: ${FRAUD_DETECTION_URL}/analyze
                    verb: POST
                    timeout: 5s

                - kafka:
                    addresses: ["${KAFKA_BROKERS}"]
                    topic: large-transactions
                    idempotent_write: true

        # International transactions to compliance
        - check: this.is_international == true
          output:
            kafka:
              addresses: ["${KAFKA_BROKERS}"]
              topic: international-transactions
              batching:
                count: 100
                period: 30s

        # Standard domestic transactions
        - output:
            kafka:
              addresses: ["${KAFKA_BROKERS}"]
              topic: domestic-transactions
              batching:
                count: 500
                period: 1m
```

**Key Pattern for CSV**: Each line becomes a message. Use `mapping` to parse CSV fields with `split()`. The scanner reads line-by-line automatically.

### Step 3: Split Nested Structures

For complex nested JSON structures, use the `unarchive` processor with field extraction:

```json title="Input: Nested order structure"
{
  "order_id": "order-12345",
  "customer": "customer-001",
  "items": [
    {"sku": "WIDGET-A", "quantity": 5, "price": 19.99, "warehouse": "US-EAST"},
    {"sku": "GADGET-B", "quantity": 2, "price": 49.99, "warehouse": "EU-WEST"}
  ],
  "shipping": {
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

Split into individual line items while preserving order and shipping context:

```yaml title="nested-structure-splitting-pipeline.yaml"
name: split-order-items
description: Split order items into individual fulfillment messages
type: pipeline
namespace: production

config:
  input:
    http_server:
      address: 0.0.0.0:8080
      path: /orders
      timeout: 5s

  pipeline:
    processors:
      # Step 1: Validate order structure
      - mapping: |
          if !this.items.exists() || this.items.type() != "array" {
            throw("Order must contain items array")
          }
          root = this

      # Step 2: Store order context in metadata
      - mapping: |
          meta order_id = this.order_id
          meta customer = this.customer
          meta shipping_address = this.shipping.address
          meta shipping_country = this.shipping.country
          root = this

      # Step 3: Split items array
      - unarchive:
          format: json_array
          field: items

      # Step 4: Reconstruct complete message for each item
      - mapping: |
          root = this
          root.order_id = meta("order_id")
          root.customer = meta("customer")
          root.shipping_address = meta("shipping_address")
          root.shipping_country = meta("shipping_country")
          root.line_total = this.quantity * this.price
          root.processed_at = now()

  output:
    switch:
      cases:
        # Route by warehouse location
        - check: this.warehouse == "US-EAST"
          output:
            kafka:
              addresses: [us-east-kafka.example.com:9092]
              topic: fulfillment-us-east
              batching:
                count: 100
                period: 5s

        - check: this.warehouse == "EU-WEST"
          output:
            kafka:
              addresses: [eu-kafka.example.com:9092]
              topic: fulfillment-eu-west
              batching:
                count: 100
                period: 5s

        # Unknown warehouse
        - output:
            file:
              path: /var/log/expanso/unknown-warehouse.jsonl
              codec: lines
```

**Pattern for Nested Structures**:
1. Extract the array field you want to split
2. Store parent context in metadata before splitting
3. Use `unarchive` with `format: json_array` and `field: items`
4. Restore parent context after splitting
5. Route individual items based on their properties

### Step 4: Split and Re-batch

After splitting for granular routing, you often want to re-batch for efficient destination delivery:

```yaml title="split-rebatch-pipeline.yaml"
name: split-and-rebatch
description: Split messages for routing, then re-batch for efficiency
type: pipeline
namespace: production

config:
  input:
    http_server:
      address: 0.0.0.0:8080
      path: /events/bulk
      timeout: 5s

  pipeline:
    processors:
      # Step 1: Store batch metadata
      - mapping: |
          meta batch_id = uuid_v4()
          meta batch_received_at = now()
          meta batch_size = this.events.length()
          root = this

      # Step 2: Split events array
      - unarchive:
          format: json_array
          field: events

      # Step 3: Enrich each event
      - mapping: |
          root = this
          root.batch_id = meta("batch_id")
          root.batch_received_at = meta("batch_received_at")
          root.original_batch_size = meta("batch_size")

          # Classify event
          root.priority = match {
            this.severity == "CRITICAL" => "high"
            this.severity == "ERROR" => "medium"
            _ => "low"
          }

  output:
    switch:
      cases:
        # High priority: Small batches, fast delivery
        - check: this.priority == "high"
          output:
            kafka:
              addresses: ["${KAFKA_BROKERS}"]
              topic: high-priority-events
              batching:
                count: 10
                period: 1s

        # Medium priority: Moderate batching
        - check: this.priority == "medium"
          output:
            kafka:
              addresses: ["${KAFKA_BROKERS}"]
              topic: medium-priority-events
              batching:
                count: 100
                period: 10s

        # Low priority: Large batches, deferred delivery
        - check: this.priority == "low"
          output:
            file:
              path: /var/expanso/low-priority/events-${!timestamp_unix_date("2006-01-02-15")}.jsonl
              codec: lines
              batching:
                count: 10000
                period: 1h
```

**Re-batching Strategy**:
- **Split first** to enable per-item routing decisions
- **Route based on item properties** (priority, destination, etc.)
- **Re-batch at output** with settings appropriate to each route
- High priority: small batches (10 items, 1 second)
- Low priority: large batches (10,000 items, 1 hour)

This pattern gives you the flexibility of per-item routing with the efficiency of batched delivery.

## Production Considerations

### Message Ordering After Splitting

**Important**: Splitting breaks message ordering within the original batch. If order matters, you have options:

**Option 1: Preserve order with sequence numbers**
```yaml
processors:
  # Before splitting, add index
  - mapping: |
      meta batch_id = uuid_v4()
      root = this

  - unarchive:
      format: json_array
      field: events

  # After splitting, add sequence
  - mapping: |
      root = this
      root.batch_id = meta("batch_id")
      root.sequence = count("sequence_" + meta("batch_id"))
```

**Option 2: Use Kafka partition keys**
```yaml
output:
  kafka:
    topic: events
    # All messages from same batch to same partition (ordered)
    key: ${!json("batch_id")}
```

### Split Limits and Memory Usage

Splitting large arrays can consume significant memory. Set limits:

```yaml
processors:
  # Validate array size before splitting
  - mapping: |
      let max_items = 10000

      if this.events.length() > $max_items {
        throw("Batch too large: " + this.events.length().string() + " items (max: " + $max_items.string() + ")")
      }
      root = this

  - unarchive:
      format: json_array
      field: events
```

**Memory Impact**:
- 1,000 items √ó 1KB each = 1MB in memory (acceptable)
- 100,000 items √ó 1KB each = 100MB in memory (problematic on edge)
- 1,000,000 items √ó 1KB each = 1GB in memory (will likely crash)

### Edge Context: Split Before Upload

Splitting at the edge (before cloud upload) provides powerful benefits:

**Before (split in cloud)**:
```
Edge: Collect 1GB of sensor arrays
      ‚Üì Upload entire 1GB to cloud
Cloud: Split arrays, route individual items

Bandwidth: 1GB upload
Latency: High (all data must reach cloud first)
```

**After (split at edge)**:
```
Edge: Collect 1GB of sensor arrays
      Split into individual readings
      Route: 50MB critical ‚Üí Cloud (immediate)
             100MB warnings ‚Üí Cloud (batched)
             850MB routine ‚Üí Local storage

Bandwidth: 150MB upload (85% reduction)
Latency: Low (critical data routed immediately)
```

**Bandwidth savings**: 85% reduction while maintaining real-time alerting on critical data.

### Handling Split Failures

What happens if a split operation fails midway through?

```yaml
# Atomic split with error handling
processors:
  - mapping: |
      # Store original message before split
      meta original_message = this.encode("json")
      root = this

  - try:
      # Attempt split
      - unarchive:
          format: json_array
          field: events

  - catch:
      # If split fails, send original to DLQ
      - mapping: |
          root = meta("original_message").decode("json")
          root.error = "Failed to split message"
          root.error_time = now()

output:
  file:
    path: /var/log/expanso/split-failures-${!timestamp_unix()}.jsonl
```

### Combining Splitting with Filtering

After splitting, you often want to filter out unwanted items:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    # Step 1: Split array
    - unarchive:
        format: json_array
        field: events

    # Step 2: Filter out items we don't want
    - mapping: |
        # Keep only ERROR and CRITICAL severity
        if this.severity == "ERROR" || this.severity == "CRITICAL" {
          root = this
        } else {
          root = deleted()
        }
```

**Example**: Input 1,000-item array (800 INFO, 150 WARNING, 50 ERROR) ‚Üí After split + filter: 50 messages (only ERROR) ‚Üí 95% reduction

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Parent Context Lost After Splitting

**Symptom**: Split messages missing device_id, batch_id, or other parent context.

**Cause**: Parent context not stored in metadata before splitting.

**Solution**:

```yaml
# WRONG: Context lost
processors:
  - unarchive:
      format: json_array
      field: events
  - mapping: |
      root.device_id = this.device_id  # Doesn't exist!

# CORRECT: Store in metadata first
processors:
  - mapping: |
      meta device_id = this.device_id
      root = this
  - unarchive:
      format: json_array
      field: events
  - mapping: |
      root = this
      root.device_id = meta("device_id")
```

### Problem: CSV Splitting Includes Header Row

**Symptom**: First CSV row (header) processed as data, causing errors.

**Solution**:

```yaml
processors:
  # Filter out header row
  - mapping: |
      if this.string().has_prefix("id,") ||
         this.string().has_prefix("transaction_id,") {
        root = deleted()
      } else {
        root = this
      }
```

### Problem: Out of Memory When Splitting Large Arrays

**Symptom**: Pipeline crashes when processing large batches.

**Solution**:

```yaml
# Add size validation
processors:
  - mapping: |
      let max_items = 10000
      let item_count = this.events.length()

      if $item_count > $max_items {
        throw("Batch size " + $item_count.string() + " exceeds maximum")
      }
      root = this
```

### Problem: Split Messages Not Routing Correctly

**Symptom**: All split messages go to default route instead of specific routes.

**Cause**: Routing conditions check fields that don't exist on split messages.

**Solution**:

```yaml title="Wrong: Field might not exist"
- check: this.severity == "CRITICAL"
  output: critical_destination
```

```yaml title="Correct: Check existence first"
- check: this.severity.exists() && this.severity == "CRITICAL"
  output: critical_destination
```

```yaml title="Better: Set defaults during enrichment"
pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = this
        root.severity = this.severity.or("INFO")
```
