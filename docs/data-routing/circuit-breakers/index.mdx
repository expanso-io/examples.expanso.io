# Circuit Breaker Patterns for Downstream Systems

Protect your edge pipelines from cascading failures when downstream systems fail.

## The Problem

When edge pipelines depend on downstream systems, failures cascade:
- Single unresponsive endpoint backs up entire pipeline
- Pending requests consume memory until crash
- No automatic recovery from transient failures

## The Solution

Learn 4 circuit breaker techniques:

1. **HTTP Client Circuit Breakers** - Fast timeouts and exponential backoff for external APIs
2. **Database Circuit Breakers** - Connection limits and query timeouts to prevent pool exhaustion
3. **Multi-Level Fallback** - Primary to secondary to local buffer to DLQ for high availability
4. **Production Monitoring** - Metrics, logging, and alerting for circuit state visibility
