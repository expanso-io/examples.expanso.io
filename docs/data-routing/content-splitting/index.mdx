# How to Implement Content-Based Splitting

Transform bundled messages into individual events for precise routing and processing.

## The Problem

Data pipelines receive bundled messages preventing granular operations:
- Single HTTP request carries 100 sensor readings
- Batch files contain thousands of transactions
- Log streams deliver multiline stack traces
- No per-event routing, transformation, or metrics

## The Solution

Learn 5 content splitting techniques:

1. **JSON Array Splitting** - Split sensor arrays with `unarchive` processor and metadata preservation
2. **CSV Batch Splitting** - Parse CSV files line-by-line with structured field mapping
3. **Nested Structure Splitting** - Split complex nested JSON while preserving hierarchical context
4. **Advanced Patterns** - Combine splitting with routing, filtering, and intelligent re-batching
5. **Production Optimization** - Size validation, atomic operations, and edge-first processing
