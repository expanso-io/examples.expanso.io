# Priority Queues for Message Routing

Transform message chaos into organized, SLA-compliant processing.

## The Problem

Without priority queuing, critical messages get stuck:
- Critical alerts wait behind millions of INFO logs
- Enterprise customers get same latency as free tier
- Payment failures compete with bulk analytics
- SLA violations and poor customer experience

## The Solution

Learn 4 priority routing techniques:

1. **Severity-Based Routing** - Map log levels (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO) to priority queues
2. **Customer Tier Routing** - Route enterprise/premium customers to dedicated high-priority queues
3. **Multi-Criteria Scoring** - Combine customer tier, event type, and urgency with weighted scoring
4. **Age-Based Escalation** - Time-based priority boost prevents low-priority message starvation
