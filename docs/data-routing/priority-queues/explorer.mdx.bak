# Interactive Priority Queue Explorer

**See priority-based routing in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 4 stages of priority queue implementation. Watch as messages are progressively routed to appropriate queues based on severity, customer tier, and multi-criteria scoring.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) JSON at each stage
3. **Observe** how messages are routed (different colors for each priority queue)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what switch configuration was added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the technique and performance benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Input
All messages flow through a single processing path regardless of importance. Critical alerts compete with routine logs, causing latency spikes and SLA violations for high-priority events.

### Stage 2: Severity-Based Routing
Messages are classified by log severity (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO) and routed to dedicated queues with appropriate batching policies. Critical messages bypass batching entirely for immediate delivery.

### Stage 3: Customer Tier Enhancement
Customer subscription tier (enterprise, premium, standard, free) influences priority classification. Premium customers get faster processing even for routine messages, while free tier users get cost-optimized batching.

### Stage 4: Multi-Criteria Scoring
Sophisticated scoring algorithm combines severity, customer tier, event type, and urgency into a numerical priority score. Messages are routed based on total score, ensuring critical payment events from enterprise customers get highest priority.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 4 stages, you now understand:

✅ **Severity-based routing** - How log levels map to different processing guarantees

✅ **Customer tier prioritization** - How subscription levels influence message handling

✅ **Multi-criteria scoring** - How to combine multiple factors into a single priority metric

✅ **Batching optimization** - How different priorities warrant different performance characteristics

## Deep Dive into Each Step

Want to understand each transformation in depth?

- [**Step 1: Severity-Based Routing**](./step-1-severity-routing) - Map log levels to priority queues with differential batching
- [**Step 2: Customer Tier Routing**](./step-2-customer-tier-routing) - Implement subscription-based priority with SLA tracking
- [**Step 3: Multi-Criteria Scoring**](./step-3-multi-criteria-scoring) - Build weighted scoring for complex prioritization
- [**Step 4: Prevent Starvation**](./step-4-prevent-starvation) - Add age-based escalation and fairness guarantees

## Common Questions

### How does this differ from simple round-robin routing?
Priority queues ensure important messages get preferential treatment rather than just distributing load evenly. A critical security alert from an enterprise customer will always process before routine analytics from free tier users.

### Can low-priority messages get completely starved?
No! Step 4 implements age-based priority boost that gradually increases priority for messages that have been waiting too long, ensuring all messages eventually process.

### What's the performance impact of priority classification?
Minimal - the mapping processor adds ~1ms latency while the performance gains from appropriate batching (immediate delivery for critical, bulk processing for routine) provide 10-100x latency improvements for high-priority traffic.

### How do I monitor if priorities are working correctly?
The pipeline exposes metrics for each priority queue (messages sent, latency, errors). You can also enable priority breakdown logging to debug unexpected classifications.
