# Setup Environment for Log Enrichment

Before building the log enrichment pipeline, you'll set up AWS credentials and create an S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

This example requires the following services to be running:

*   **[Kafka](/getting-started/services/kafka)**

Before you begin, please ensure these services are set up and running according to their respective guides. Additionally, ensure you have completed the [Local Development Setup](/getting-started/local-development) guide for general environment configuration.

## Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials

Set up AWS credentials for S3 access:

```bash
# Configure AWS profile (recommended)
aws configure --profile expanso-demo
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Key, and region

# Test AWS credentials
aws s3 ls --profile expanso-demo
```

## Step 2: Create S3 Bucket

Create an S3 bucket for storing enriched logs:

```bash
# Create S3 bucket (replace with unique name)
aws s3 mb s3://your-company-logs-demo --profile expanso-demo

# Verify bucket creation
aws s3 ls --profile expanso-demo | grep your-company-logs-demo
```

## Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

Set environment variables that will be used in the enrichment steps:

```bash
# Set node identification
export NODE_ID="edge-node-demo"

# Set pipeline identification
export PIPELINE_NAME="log-enrichment-s3-demo"

# Set AWS region (if using environment variables)
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Verify variables are set
echo "Node ID: $NODE_ID"
echo "Pipeline: $PIPELINE_NAME"
echo "Region: $AWS_REGION"
```

## Next Steps

✅ Your environment is now configured for log enrichment!
