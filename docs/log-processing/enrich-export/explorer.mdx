# Interactive Log Enrichment Explorer

**See log enrichment in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 5 stages of log processing. Watch as raw application logs are progressively enriched with metadata, restructured for analytics, and prepared for efficient S3 storage.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) JSON at each stage
3. **Observe** how fields are added (green highlight) or restructured (organizational changes)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what processor was added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the technique and business benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Log Data
Raw application logs generated by your services, containing basic event information but lacking processing context and optimization for analytics.

### Stage 2: Add Lineage Metadata
Enhanced with processing metadata including node identification, pipeline information, and processing timestamps for complete audit trails and debugging.

### Stage 3: Restructure to Event/Metadata Format
Reorganized into a clean separation between business event data and operational metadata, optimizing for different analytics use cases.

### Stage 4: Configure Batching
Messages are grouped efficiently to minimize S3 API calls and storage costs while maintaining reasonable processing latency.

### Stage 5: Ready for S3 Export
Final format optimized for JSON Lines storage in Amazon S3 with proper partitioning and metadata organization for analytics workloads.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 5 stages, you now understand:

✅ **Lineage Tracking** - How to add processing metadata for audit trails and debugging
✅ **Data Restructuring** - How to separate business events from operational metadata
✅ **Batching Strategy** - How to optimize for cost and performance in cloud storage
✅ **Analytics Preparation** - How to format data for efficient querying and processing

- [**Step 1: Generate Test Data**](./step-1-generate-test-data) - Set up synthetic log generation for testing
- [**Step 2: Add Lineage Metadata**](./step-2-add-lineage-metadata) - Track processing history and context
- [**Step 3: Restructure Format**](./step-3-restructure-format) - Organize for analytics efficiency
- [**Step 4: Configure Batching**](./step-4-configure-batching) - Optimize cloud storage costs
- [**Step 5: Export to S3**](./step-5-export-s3) - Integrate with cloud storage

## Common Questions

### Why separate event data from metadata?
Separating business events from operational metadata allows analytics teams to focus on business insights while operations teams can track processing performance and audit trails independently.

### How does batching reduce costs?
Amazon S3 charges per API request. By batching 10-100 messages into a single file upload instead of individual uploads, you can reduce costs by 90-95% while only adding seconds of latency.

### What if I need real-time processing?
You can adjust batching parameters (`count: 1`, `period: 1s`) for near real-time processing, or use multiple outputs to send urgent events immediately while still batching others for cost efficiency.

### How do I handle different log formats?
This pipeline works with any JSON logs. For other formats, add parsing processors before enrichment. See [Parse Structured Logs](../../data-transformation/parse-logs) for examples.
