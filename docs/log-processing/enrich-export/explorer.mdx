# Interactive Log Enrichment Explorer

**See log enrichment in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 5 stages of log processing. Watch as raw application logs are progressively enriched with metadata, restructured for analytics, and prepared for efficient S3 storage.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) JSON at each stage
3. **Observe** how fields are added (green highlight) or restructured (organizational changes)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what processor was added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the technique and business benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original Log Data
Raw application logs generated by your services, containing basic event information but lacking processing context and optimization for analytics.

### Stage 2: Add Lineage Metadata
Enhanced with processing metadata including node identification, pipeline information, and processing timestamps for complete audit trails and debugging.

### Stage 3: Restructure to Event/Metadata Format
Reorganized into a clean separation between business event data and operational metadata, optimizing for different analytics use cases.

### Stage 4: Configure Batching
Messages are grouped efficiently to minimize S3 API calls and storage costs while maintaining reasonable processing latency.

### Stage 5: Ready for S3 Export
Final format optimized for JSON Lines storage in Amazon S3 with proper partitioning and metadata organization for analytics workloads.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 5 stages, you now understand:

✅ **Lineage Tracking** - How to add processing metadata for audit trails and debugging
✅ **Data Restructuring** - How to separate business events from operational metadata
✅ **Batching Strategy** - How to optimize for cost and performance in cloud storage
✅ **Analytics Preparation** - How to format data for efficient querying and processing
