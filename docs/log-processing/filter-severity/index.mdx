# Log Severity Filtering

Transform noisy application logs into actionable intelligence by filtering on severity.

## The Problem

Application logs contain massive amounts of noise:
- INFO and DEBUG entries drown out critical errors
- Critical errors risk getting lost
- 80-95% of log volume provides no actionable value
- Expensive storage and transmission costs

## The Solution

Learn 3 log processing techniques:

1. **JSON Parsing with Fallback** - Parse JSON where possible, preserve raw text when not
2. **Severity-Based Filtering** - Filter pipeline to only ERROR and WARN levels for 80-95% volume reduction
3. **Conditional Routing** - Switch output based on severity level (errors to files, warnings to monitoring)

## Get Started
