# Production Log Processing Pipeline

Build an enterprise-grade log processing pipeline that handles millions of events at the edge.

## The Problem

Modern applications generate massive log volumes needing immediate processing:
- Raw logs are noisy, inconsistent, contain sensitive data
- Multiple formats from different sources
- Need real-time processing, enrichment, and routing
- Compliance requires PII redaction before storage

## The Solution

Learn 6 production-ready techniques:

1. **HTTP Input Configuration** - Rate-limited HTTP endpoints with authentication and validation
2. **Parse and Validate** - JSON parsing with field validation and error handling
3. **Enrich Metadata** - Node location, processing timestamps, and operational metadata
4. **Filter and Score** - Severity scores and debug log filtering for 60-80% bandwidth reduction
5. **Redact Sensitive Data** - Field-level hashing and deletion for GDPR/HIPAA compliance
6. **Fan-Out Pattern** - Parallel routing to Elasticsearch, S3, and backup systems
