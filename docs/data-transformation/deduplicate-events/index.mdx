# Deduplicate Events

Eliminate duplicate events from distributed systems with at-least-once delivery guarantees.

## The Problem

At-least-once delivery creates inevitable duplicates:
- Network retries create identical events
- Load balancer failovers duplicate actions
- Duplicates corrupt analytics, trigger redundant actions, waste processing
- No exactly-once guarantee

## The Solution

Learn 4 deduplication strategies:

1. **Hash-Based Deduplication** - SHA-256 content hashing with in-memory cache for exact duplicates
2. **Fingerprint-Based Deduplication** - Hash business-critical fields for semantic duplicate detection
3. **ID-Based Deduplication** - Cache event ID directly for systems with guaranteed unique IDs
4. **Production Configuration** - Redis-backed cache with consistent hashing for multi-node deployments
