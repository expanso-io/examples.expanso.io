# Aggregate Time Windows

**Transform high-frequency event streams into meaningful analytics by grouping data into time buckets**. This step-by-step guide teaches you 5 essential windowing techniques through an interactive explorer and hands-on exercises.

## The Problem

IoT devices, sensors, and applications generate continuous streams of high-frequency events. Sending all this raw data to the cloud is expensive and overwhelming:

```json
{
  "sensor_id": "temp_42",
  "temperature": 72.3,  // ❌ 60 events/minute × 1000 sensors = 60,000/min
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:23:45.123Z"
}
```

**The challenge:** Raw event streams generate 98% redundant data volume, overwhelm cloud analytics, and provide no actionable insights.

## The Solution: 5 Time-Windowed Aggregation Techniques

This guide teaches you how to apply the right windowing technique for each analytics use case:

### 1. **Tumbling Windows** → Real-time dashboards
Fixed-size, non-overlapping buckets for precise period-based analytics
- **Use case:** Hourly traffic summaries, daily transaction counts
- **Method:** Round timestamps to window boundaries
- **Result:** 98%+ data reduction with exact window boundaries

### 2. **Sliding Windows** → Trend analysis
Overlapping windows for smoothed moving averages and trending
- **Use case:** 5-minute moving averages with 1-minute updates  
- **Method:** Multiple overlapping time buckets per event
- **Result:** Smoother trends, early anomaly detection

### 3. **Session Windows** → User activity clustering
Dynamic windows based on activity gaps for behavioral analytics
- **Use case:** User session analysis, transaction grouping
- **Method:** Gap-based window boundaries (e.g., 5-minute inactivity)
- **Result:** Variable-length windows matching natural activity patterns

### 4. **Multi-Level Aggregation** → Hierarchical analytics
Simultaneous aggregation at sensor, location, and global levels
- **Use case:** Drill-down dashboards, regional comparisons
- **Method:** Multiple grouping keys in parallel branches
- **Result:** Complete analytics hierarchy in a single pipeline

### 5. **Production Buffering** → Reliability & scale
Memory management, late arrivals, and network outage handling
- **Use case:** Production IoT deployments, edge processing
- **Method:** Cache tuning, grace periods, disk buffering
- **Result:** 99.9% uptime with guaranteed data delivery

## Why Process at the Edge?

**Cost Savings:** Reduce cloud ingestion costs by 98% (60,000 → 1,000 events/minute)
**Real-time Insights:** Sub-second aggregations vs. cloud batch processing delays
**Bandwidth Efficiency:** Send summaries not raw data over expensive cellular/satellite
**Compliance:** Local aggregation before sensitive data leaves premises

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

✅ **Design optimal window strategies** for your specific analytics requirements
✅ **Implement tumbling, sliding, and session windows** with proper memory management
✅ **Calculate percentiles, moving averages, and multi-dimensional aggregations** at edge scale

## Real-World Impact

**Before Time-Windowed Aggregation:**
```
- Cloud ingestion: 60,000 events/minute × $0.10/MB = $2,160/month
- Dashboard latency: 5-15 minute batch delays
- Storage costs: 43GB/day × $0.023/GB = $360/month
```

**After Time-Windowed Aggregation:**
```
- Cloud ingestion: 1,000 summaries/minute × $0.10/MB = $36/month
- Dashboard latency: Real-time (sub-second)
- Storage costs: 720MB/day × $0.023/GB = $6/month
```

**Total monthly savings: $2,478 (94% cost reduction)**
