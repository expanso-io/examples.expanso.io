# Aggregate Time Windows

Transform high-frequency event streams into meaningful analytics by grouping data into time buckets.

## The Problem

IoT devices and sensors generate continuous high-frequency events:
- 60 events/minute per sensor creates overwhelming data volume
- Raw streams generate 98% redundant data
- No actionable insights from individual readings
- Expensive cloud ingestion and storage costs

## The Solution

Learn 5 time-windowed aggregation techniques:

1. **Tumbling Windows** - Fixed-size, non-overlapping buckets with timestamp rounding
2. **Sliding Windows** - Overlapping windows for smoothed moving averages and trending
3. **Session Windows** - Dynamic windows based on activity gaps for behavioral analytics
4. **Multi-Level Aggregation** - Simultaneous aggregation at sensor, location, and global levels
5. **Production Buffering** - Memory management, late arrivals, and network outage handling
