# Interactive Aggregate Time Windows Explorer

**See time-windowed aggregation in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 5 stages of data transformation. Watch as high-frequency event streams are progressively aggregated into meaningful analytics summaries.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) JSON at each stage
3. **Observe** how data is grouped (blue highlight) and aggregated (green highlight)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what transformation was added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the windowing technique and analytics benefit
