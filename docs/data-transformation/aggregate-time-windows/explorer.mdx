# Interactive Aggregate Time Windows Explorer

**See time-windowed aggregation in action!** Use the interactive explorer below to step through 5 stages of data transformation. Watch as high-frequency event streams are progressively aggregated into meaningful analytics summaries.

## How to Use This Explorer

1. **Navigate** using arrow keys (← →) or click the numbered stage buttons
2. **Compare** the Input (left) and Output (right) JSON at each stage
3. **Observe** how data is grouped (blue highlight) and aggregated (green highlight)
4. **Inspect** the YAML code showing exactly what transformation was added
5. **Learn** from the stage description explaining the windowing technique and analytics benefit

## Understanding the Stages

### Stage 1: Original High-Frequency Events
Raw sensor data streaming at 60 events/minute per sensor, creating overwhelming data volume.

### Stage 2: Tumbling Window Aggregation
Fixed 1-minute windows aggregate events into precise period-based summaries with 98% data reduction.

### Stage 3: Sliding Window Trends
5-minute overlapping windows create smoothed moving averages for trend analysis and anomaly detection.

### Stage 4: Session-Based Activity Clustering
Dynamic windows group events by activity patterns, creating variable-length analytics windows.

### Stage 5: Production-Ready Multi-Level Analytics
Complete hierarchical aggregation with memory management, buffering, and reliability features.

## What You've Learned

After exploring all 5 stages, you now understand:

✅ **Tumbling vs. Sliding Windows** - When to use fixed boundaries vs. overlapping trends
✅ **Session Window Dynamics** - How to group events by natural activity patterns
✅ **Multi-Level Aggregation** - Creating sensor, location, and global analytics simultaneously
✅ **Production Optimization** - Memory management, late arrivals, and reliability patterns
