Here is the plan for refactoring the documentation:

1.  **Audit all `setup.mdx` files:** Go through each `setup.mdx` file in the `docs` directory and create a list of all the repeated sections. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Prerequisites installation (Kafka, Postgres, etc.)
    *   Environment variable setup
    *   Deploying a "shell" or "verification" pipeline
    *   Running tests
    *   Embedded mock service scripts

2.  **Consolidate common setup instructions:** Move all the common setup instructions into a single, centralized guide in `docs/getting-started/local-development.mdx`. This guide will become the single source of truth for setting up the local development environment.

3.  **Externalize mock service scripts:** For any examples that use mock services, extract the embedded scripts into their own runnable files (e.g., `scripts/mock-services/some-service.py`) or, preferably, create dedicated Docker containers for them. This will make the examples cleaner and easier to understand.

4.  **Update example `setup.mdx` files:** Once the common guide is created, go back to each example's `setup.mdx` file and remove all the duplicated content. Replace it with a link to the centralized guide, and only keep the instructions that are unique to that specific example.

5.  **Update the root `docker-compose.yml`:** Ensure that the root `docker-compose.yml` file defines all the common services that are needed for the examples (Kafka, Postgres, etc.). This will allow users to start all the necessary services with a single command.

6.  **Validate the changes:** After the refactoring is complete, pick a few examples from different categories and run through them from start to finish. This will ensure that the new structure is easy to follow and that the examples are still self-contained.
